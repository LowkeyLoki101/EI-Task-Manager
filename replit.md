# Emergent Intelligence

## Overview
Emergent Intelligence is an AI-powered project management platform designed to streamline project workflows through advanced AI capabilities. It integrates task management, calendar synchronization, research assistance, and a central knowledge base. The platform features a triple voice system, n8n automation, an autonomous chat system with persistent memory, and a GPT-5 diary system for relationship building and idea generation. A key feature is its role as a central hub in a distributed AI agent network, enabling cross-service collaboration, task delegation to specialized AI agents, and shared research capabilities. The system supports conversational task creation, automated workflow suggestions, cross-device calendar sync, and AI-powered research, with a focus on building relationships and coordinating AI agents across a network. It also includes an autopoietic (self-growing) diary system that autonomously thinks, researches, and builds knowledge, incorporating a 5-step thinking methodology (Colby-Style Lens Processing) and an evolving self-question pool. This system can generate actionable business tasks from its thinking cycles and visually displays its cognitive processes in real-time within an AI workstation.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface design: Clean, mobile-first interface without technical backend details exposed to users. Single voice interface only.
Chat behavior: No disruptive auto-scrolling when user is typing - allow natural interaction without forcing scroll position changes.

## Development Methodology
**Self-Diagnostic & Improvement Framework**: All code generation, editing, and refactoring must follow the 6-step framework:
1. **Investigation** - Parse output critically for truncation, paraphrasing, missing details
2. **Diagnostic Report** - Structured analysis before final code output
3. **Fortify & Enhance** - Rewrite weak sections completely, expand placeholders
4. **Adjust for Drift** - Compare against earlier instructions, realign to canonical form
5. **Final Output Policy** - Provide both diagnostic report and corrected code separately
6. **Continuous Improvement** - Integrate lessons from prior diagnostics
Never skip steps. Always investigate â†’ diagnose â†’ fortify â†’ correct â†’ output.
