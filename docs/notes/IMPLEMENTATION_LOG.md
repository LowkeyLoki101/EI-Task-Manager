**Implemented**:
- Basic React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- Express.js backend with TypeScript
- Task management data models (shared/schema.ts)
- In-memory storage system with file persistence
- Basic UI components using shadcn/ui

**Key Decisions**:
- Chose in-memory storage over immediate database for rapid prototyping
- Used shadcn/ui for consistent component library
- Implemented session-based task isolation

### Phase 2: AI Integration (GPT-5 Implementation)
**Date**: Mid-development phase
**Implemented**:
- GPT-4o integration for autonomous chat
- Persistent memory system (GPT Diary)
- Trust level relationship tracking
- Autonomous action capabilities (task creation, research)

**Key Decisions**:
- Used GPT-4o (latest model) instead of GPT-4
- Implemented trust system starting at 50% for realistic relationship building
- Created memory persistence for cross-session learning

**Technical Challenges**:
- Managing conversation context and memory efficiently
- Balancing autonomous actions with user control
- Implementing proper error handling for AI failures

### Phase 3: Voice Integration (ElevenLabs)
**Date**: Voice system implementation
**Implemented**:
- ElevenLabs ConvAI widget integration
- Agent configuration (agent_7401k28d3x9kfdntv7cjrj6t43be)
- Dynamic session variable injection
- Voice-to-task creation pipeline

**Key Decisions**:
- Used ElevenLabs ConvAI over custom voice implementation for speed
- Implemented session linking between voice and task management
- Created duplicate widget prevention system

**Technical Challenges**:
- React component lifecycle management for external widgets
- Session variable synchronization
- Widget cleanup and re-mounting

### Phase 4: File Upload System (Recent Implementation)
**Date**: Latest development phase
**Implemented**:
- Multer-based file upload handling
- GPT-4o vision API for image analysis
- Automatic task extraction from screenshots
- File type validation and security measures

**Key Decisions**:
- Used multer for file handling instead of cloud storage initially
- Implemented automatic file cleanup to prevent disk bloat
- Added comprehensive file type validation

**Technical Challenges Encountered**:
1. **File Type Validation Issues**: Initial regex-based validation too restrictive
2. **MIME Type Inconsistencies**: Screenshots had unexpected MIME types
3. **TypeScript Vision API Integration**: Complex message format requirements
4. **Error Handling**: Multer error handling needed custom wrapper

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Flexible MIME Type Validation**: Whitelist approach with fallback for any image/*
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Custom multer wrapper with proper error responses
3. **Vision API Message Format**: Proper array-based content structure for text + images
4. **Logging and Debugging**: Added extensive logging throughout upload process

### Phase 5: Documentation and Developer Handover (Current)
**Date**: Current phase
**Implemented**:
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Developer handover guide
- Troubleshooting documentation
- ElevenLabs integration consolidation

## Architecture Evolution

### Initial Architecture
```
Frontend (React) → Backend (Express) → In-Memory Storage
```

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend (React + Voice Widget) 
    ↓
Backend (Express + AI Services)
    ↓
Storage Layer (In-Memory + File Persistence)
    ↓
External APIs (OpenAI + ElevenLabs + N8N)
```

### Planned Architecture
```
Frontend (React + Voice Widget)
    ↓
Backend (Express + AI Services)
    ↓
Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Drizzle)
    ↓
Cloud Storage (File Uploads)
    ↓

```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Start with in-memory storage, migrate to PostgreSQL
- **Reasoning**: Faster prototyping, easier debugging
- **Status**: Migration framework in place, ready for production

### AI Model Selection
- **Decision**: GPT-4o for all AI operations
- **Reasoning**: Latest model with vision capabilities
- **Alternative Considered**: GPT-4 (older, no vision)

### Voice Integration Approach
- **Decision**: ElevenLabs ConvAI widget vs custom implementation
- **Reasoning**: Faster implementation, professional quality
- **Trade-off**: Less control over voice pipeline

### File Upload Strategy
- **Decision**: Multer with local storage vs cloud storage
- **Reasoning**: Simpler development setup
- **Future**: Migrate to cloud storage for production

### Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Function components with hooks vs class components
- **Reasoning**: Modern React patterns, easier state management
- **Implementation**: Consistent throughout application

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance Profile
- **Frontend**: React Query caching, component-level optimization
- **Backend**: In-memory storage for fast access, async operations
- **AI**: Direct API calls, no caching for dynamic responses
- **File Processing**: Memory-based with immediate cleanup

### Identified Bottlenecks
1. **File Upload Processing**: Memory-intensive for large files
2. **AI Response Times**: Network latency to OpenAI API
3. **Voice Widget Loading**: External script dependency
4. **Session Management**: No persistent sessions across browser restarts

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Implement streaming file processing**
2. **Add response caching for common AI queries**
3. **Lazy load voice widget only when needed**
4. **Add session persistence to database**

## Security Implementation

### Current Security Measures
- Environment variable API key storage
- File type validation and size limits
- Session-based data isolation
- Input validation with Zod schemas

### Security Gaps
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- No user authentication system
- File uploads stored locally (security risk)
- No input sanitization for AI prompts

### Planned Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Add user authentication (OAuth or similar)
- Migrate to secure cloud storage
- Add prompt injection protection

## Integration Challenges

### ElevenLabs Integration
- **Challenge**: Widget lifecycle management in React
- **Solution**: Custom cleanup and mounting logic
- **Lesson**: External widgets need careful integration planning

### OpenAI Integration
- **Challenge**: Vision API message format complexity
- **Solution**: Proper content array structure
- **Lesson**: Read API documentation carefully for complex features

### N8N Integration
- **Challenge**: Service connectivity in development
- **Solution**: Graceful degradation when service unavailable
- **Lesson**: Always plan for external service failures

## Code Quality Evolution

### Initial Code Quality
- Basic TypeScript coverage
