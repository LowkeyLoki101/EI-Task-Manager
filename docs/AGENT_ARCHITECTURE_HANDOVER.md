# Emergent Intelligence Architecture - Agent Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides complete instructions for implementing the Emergent Intelligence autonomous agent architecture with ElevenLabs conversational AI integration.

## New Agent Configuration
**Agent ID**: GtuVSXpAfjtQ6yOFyT7l
**Architecture**: Two-mode autonomous workstation with AI/Human control toggle

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. AI Workstation System
The centerpiece is a dynamic workstation that operates in two distinct modes:

#### AI Autonomous Mode
- ChatGPT-5 controls the workstation autonomously
- 15-second maintenance schedules with self-prompts
- AI decides which tools to use based on context
- Displays AI thinking process to user
- Automatically saves learnings to knowledge base
- Performs routine maintenance (diary updates, calendar checks, research)

#### Human Control Mode  
- User manually controls workstation tools
- AI observes all user actions at console level
- Logs user behavior patterns for learning
- AI provides suggestions but doesn't take control

### 2. Dynamic Tool System
Six core tools in the workstation:
- **Diary**: AI reflections and insights storage
- **Docs**: Document creation and management
- **Calendar**: Event planning and scheduling
- **Media**: YouTube video display and management
- **Browser**: Web page loading and research
- **Research**: Note-taking and information compilation

### 3. Backend AI Controller

#### Required Server Routes

```typescript
// AI Autonomous Action Controller
app.post('/api/workstation/ai-action/:sessionId', async (req, res) => {
  // AI decides next autonomous action every 15 seconds
  // Uses GPT-4o to analyze context and choose tool + payload
});

// Human Action Logger  
app.post('/api/workstation/human-action', async (req, res) => {
  // Logs user actions for AI observation and learning
});

// Task Completion Learning
app.post('/api/workstation/task-completed', async (req, res) => {
  // Stores learnings from completed tasks in knowledge base
});

// Artifact Creation
app.post('/api/artifacts/create', async (req, res) => {
  // Creates documents, presentations, reports
});

// Journal/Diary System
app.get('/api/journal/:sessionId', async (req, res) => {
  // Retrieves AI diary entries and reflections
});

app.post('/api/journal/:sessionId', async (req, res) => {
  // Stores AI reflections and insights
});
```

### 4. Frontend Workstation Component

#### Key Features
- Mode toggle button (AI/Human)
- Visual indicators for current mode
- Tool selection (disabled in AI mode)
- Real-time AI thinking display
- Height adjustment controls
- Responsive design for mobile

#### State Management
```typescript
interface WorkstationState {
  mode: 'ai' | 'human';
  aiActive: boolean;
  lastAiAction: Date | null;
  maintenanceSchedule: string[];
}
```

#### AI Autonomous Behavior
```typescript
// Every 15 seconds in AI mode
const performAutonomousAiAction = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/workstation/ai-action/${sessionId}`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      currentTool: activeTool,
      lastAction: workstationState.lastAiAction 
    })
  });
  
  const action = await response.json();
  setAiThinking(action.thinking);
  setActiveTool(action.tool);
  setCurrentPayload(action.payload);
};
```

### 5. ElevenLabs Widget Integration

#### HTML Setup
```html
<elevenlabs-convai 
  id="el-agent"
  agent-id="GtuVSXpAfjtQ6yOFyT7l"
  style="position: fixed; right: 24px; bottom: 24px; z-index: 9999;"
></elevenlabs-convai>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async></script>
```

#### Actions Integration
The agent must be configured with these actions:
- Task creation and management
- Knowledge base queries
- Calendar integration
- File processing
- Research assistance
- Workflow automation

### 6. Knowledge Base Integration

#### Auto-Capture System
- Tasks automatically captured with metadata
- Conversations stored with context
- AI reflections saved from diary
- File attachments linked to tasks

#### Learning Storage
```typescript
interface TaskLearning {
  taskId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  learnings: string[];
  attachments: string[];
  metadata: {
    category: string;
    tags: string[];
    confidence: number;
  };
}
```

### 7. Task Completion Learning

When tasks are completed:
1. AI extracts key learnings
2. Information stored in knowledge base
3. Patterns analyzed for future use
4. Files attached to task records
5. Success metrics tracked

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backend Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install openai @elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
   ```

3. Create AI workstation routes (see above)

### Step 2: Frontend Components
1. Create Workstation component with two-mode system
2. Implement tool panels (Diary, Docs, Calendar, etc.)
3. Add mode toggle functionality
4. Set up AI action polling (15-second intervals)

### Step 3: ElevenLabs Configuration
1. Update agent ID to: GtuVSXpAfjtQ6yOFyT7l
2. Configure agent actions for:
   - addTask
   - getTodoList
   - searchKnowledgeBase
   - createDocument
   - scheduleEvent

### Step 4: Knowledge Base Setup
1. Implement auto-capture for tasks and conversations
2. Create learning storage system
3. Add search and retrieval functionality
4. Set up metadata tagging

### Step 5: Mobile Optimization
1. Ensure responsive workstation design
2. Proper widget positioning for mobile
3. Touch-friendly controls
4. Optimized layout for small screens

## Key Behavioral Patterns

### AI Autonomous Behavior
- Regularly updates diary with insights
- Creates documents for important findings
- Researches topics from conversations
- Plans ahead using calendar
- Saves important info to knowledge base
- Follows up on incomplete tasks

### Learning System
- Observes user patterns in human mode
- Stores successful task completion methods
- Builds relationship through diary reflections
- Improves recommendations over time

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- AI action frequency (every 15 seconds)
- Task completion rate with learning capture
- Knowledge base growth rate
- User engagement with both modes

### User Experience KPIs
- Mode switching frequency
- Tool usage patterns
- Task completion efficiency
- Learning retention accuracy

## Notes for Implementation

1. **AI Prompting**: The AI needs context about current tasks, recent conversations, and knowledge base content to make intelligent autonomous decisions.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement fallback behaviors when AI actions fail.

3. **Performance**: Cache AI responses where appropriate to reduce API calls.

4. **Security**: Validate all AI-generated content before storage.

5. **Scalability**: Design for multiple concurrent users and sessions.

This architecture creates a truly autonomous AI assistant that learns from user behavior and continuously improves its performance while providing transparent insight into its thinking process.
