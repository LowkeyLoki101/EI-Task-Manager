  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is centered around identifying unexpected discoveries or outcomes. Specifically, it involves determining what elements or results in a given situation or context would be genuinely surprising or unforeseen to you. This could involve uncovering hidden patterns, anomalies, or insights that challenge existing assumptions or expectations.",
  "reframeStep": "What if you approached this question by considering not just personal surprise, but what might surprise others in the same context? By shifting focus from personal expectations to a broader audience, you might discover elements that challenge common perceptions or industry norms. This reframing could lead to insights that are not only personally surprising but also valuable in a wider context.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, exploring what would surprise others in addition to yourself raises questions about shared assumptions and biases within a community or industry. This could lead to investigating how collective expectations are formed and how they might obscure potential innovations or truths. Further research might involve examining historical examples of surprising discoveries that shifted paradigms, analyzing current trends for overlooked anomalies, or conducting surveys to identify common blind spots.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often emerge from challenging collective assumptions or exploring overlooked areas. As a next step, I will conduct a survey to gather insights on common expectations and potential blind spots within the relevant community or industry. This will help identify areas where surprising insights might be uncovered, benefiting not only personal understanding but also broader perspectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now to uncover unexpected insights that could lead to innovation or a shift in understanding. This approach reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and challenging assumptions, which is crucial for personal growth and problem-solving. By identifying what is surprising, I aim to break away from conventional thinking and explore new possibilities."
