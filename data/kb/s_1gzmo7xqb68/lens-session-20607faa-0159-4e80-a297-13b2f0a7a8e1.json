  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see that the problem I'm avoiding is confronting a specific issue or decision that may be causing discomfort or anxiety. This could be related to a personal, professional, or emotional challenge that I have been intentionally ignoring or procrastinating on addressing. Itâ€™s important to identify and acknowledge this issue to begin working towards a resolution.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different angle, consider that the problem you might be avoiding isn't necessarily negative but could be an opportunity that requires stepping outside your comfort zone. Instead of viewing it as a source of anxiety, reframe it as a potential avenue for personal growth or career advancement. By addressing it, you might unlock new skills or experiences that could enhance your life in unexpected ways.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this problem recursively could lead to questions about the underlying fears or beliefs that are causing avoidance. What specific fears (e.g., fear of failure, fear of change) are at play, and where do these fears originate? It might also be worth investigating how past experiences or learned behaviors contribute to this avoidance pattern and what strategies can be implemented to alter this mindset and effectively address the issue.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves stepping out of my comfort zone due to underlying fears of failure or change. As a next step, I will set aside time to reflect on these fears, perhaps journaling to uncover their roots, and then create a small, actionable plan to address the issue incrementally. This might involve seeking advice from a mentor or taking a small step towards confronting the challenge directly.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this issue through a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a recurring pattern of avoidance when facing discomfort or uncertainty. This pattern may stem from a fear of failure or an unwillingness to disrupt the status quo. Understanding this tendency can help me develop strategies to confront these issues head-on, fostering resilience and growth rather than allowing avoidance to dictate my actions."
