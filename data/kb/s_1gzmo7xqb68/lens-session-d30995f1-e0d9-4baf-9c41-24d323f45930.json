  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an engaging story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience today. This requires understanding current trends, audience preferences, and the unique value proposition of the product or service being marketed. The goal is to create a compelling narrative that captures attention and encourages engagement.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the story hook as an opportunity to highlight a shared experience or common challenge rather than just focusing on the product's features. This could mean crafting a narrative that emphasizes a community or social movement, aligning the product with broader societal trends or values. For example, instead of solely promoting a tech gadget's specifications, create a story about how it empowers users to connect more meaningfully with their loved ones, tapping into the universal desire for connection and belonging.",

  "recursiveStep": "What are the current societal trends or movements that could be leveraged to create a more meaningful and relevant story hook in marketing content? How can we incorporate emerging technologies, like AI or AR, to enhance storytelling and engagement with modern audiences? Additionally, what untapped emotional or psychological triggers could be explored to deepen the connection between the audience and the brand?",
  "closureStep": "The working hypothesis is to craft a story hook that taps into the current societal trend of digital connection and emotional fulfillment. The next step is to create a narrative that highlights how the product or service enables deeper, more meaningful interactions in a digitally-driven world. This involves using emerging technologies, like AI or AR, to enhance the storytelling experience and engage the audience on a personal level. I will begin by researching recent successful marketing campaigns that utilized these themes and technologies to guide the development of my content strategy.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about creating a marketing story hook right now is likely driven by the need to stay relevant and effectively engage with your audience in a rapidly changing market. The pattern you might be repeating is focusing primarily on the product's features or current trends without considering deeper emotional or societal connections that could create a more resonant narrative. By stepping back, you can identify these patterns and adjust your approach to incorporate broader, more timeless themes that align with your audience's values and experiences."
