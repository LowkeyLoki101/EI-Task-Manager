  "frameStep": "In framing the problem of staying informed about industry trends, the key is to identify the most significant developments currently impacting your sector. This includes technological advancements, regulatory changes, and shifting consumer behaviors. By pinpointing these areas, you can focus your attention on understanding their implications and adapting your strategies accordingly.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the question to focus on the future rather than the present: \"What emerging trends or potential disruptions could redefine my industry in the next few years?\" This shifts attention from current developments to anticipating future changes, encouraging proactive rather than reactive strategies. Additionally, consider the perspective of your customers or clients: \"How are the needs and expectations of my target audience evolving, and what innovations could I introduce to meet and exceed these expectations?\" This angle emphasizes the importance of customer-centric innovation in staying ahead of industry changes.",
