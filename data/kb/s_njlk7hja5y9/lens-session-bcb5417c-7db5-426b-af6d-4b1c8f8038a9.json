  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a potentially important question that I haven't considered recently, which may have implications for my personal growth, decision-making, or understanding of a current situation. By framing it, I see the need to reflect on areas of my life that I might have overlooked or taken for granted, such as my long-term goals, personal relationships, or self-care routines. This involves pinpointing an aspect of my life where revisiting foundational questions could provide new insights or clarity.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the question could involve considering areas of my life where assumptions are made without much thought. Instead of focusing solely on personal growth or relationships, I might explore questions related to my beliefs or biases, such as \"What assumptions do I routinely make that I haven't challenged recently?\" This could lead to examining deeply ingrained perspectives that influence my decisions and interactions, offering a new dimension of self-awareness and growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the question of assumptions I haven't challenged recently, I can delve deeper into understanding how these assumptions shape my worldview and behaviors. This raises further questions like, \"How do these unexamined beliefs impact my interactions with others?\" and \"What new perspectives or information could challenge these assumptions?\" Investigating these could lead to a more nuanced understanding of my biases and open the door to personal and relational growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging the assumptions I routinely make, I can gain new insights into my personal biases and how they affect my interactions and decisions. The next step is to actively reflect on recent decisions or interactions, identify any underlying assumptions, and seek out diverse perspectives or information that might offer a fresh viewpoint. This process will not only enhance my self-awareness but also promote personal growth and more meaningful relationships.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it prompts introspection and self-awareness, which are crucial for personal growth and adaptation. This pattern of questioning suggests a recurring theme in my approach: a desire to periodically reassess and challenge my assumptions to ensure I'm not operating on outdated beliefs or overlooking important aspects of my life. This reflective practice helps me stay aligned with my values and goals."
