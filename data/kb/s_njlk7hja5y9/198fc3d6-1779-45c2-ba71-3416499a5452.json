  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will not only help in identifying alternative pathways and overlooked details but also enhance my understanding of the system's core principles. The next step is to select a specific problem and deliberately apply a reverse problem-solving approach, documenting the process and outcomes to analyze its effectiveness and potential insights. This will provide concrete evidence on the value of this approach and guide further applications.",
