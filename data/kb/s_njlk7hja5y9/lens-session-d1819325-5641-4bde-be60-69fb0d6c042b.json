  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the outcomes of tackling a problem from its conclusion or end goals first, rather than starting from the beginning. By approaching the problem backwards, I see the potential to identify overlooked assumptions or solutions that become apparent only when considering the desired end state. This method might reveal new pathways or efficiencies that are not obvious when using a traditional forward-thinking approach.",
  "reframeStep": "From the perspective of a creative problem-solving approach, reframing the problem by starting from the end goal could lead to innovative solutions that are not bound by conventional methods. This perspective encourages thinking outside the box and allows for a more flexible approach, where the focus is on desired outcomes rather than the limitations of the current situation. It might also empower more strategic prioritization, where resources and efforts are allocated more effectively by understanding what truly matters for achieving the end result.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the approach of solving a problem backwards, new questions arise such as: What assumptions might have been overlooked initially that become clear when starting from the end goal? How can this backward approach be systematically applied across different domains or types of problems? Further investigation could focus on successful case studies where a reverse-engineering method led to breakthroughs, and research could delve into developing a framework or toolkit for effectively implementing backward problem-solving strategies.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching problems backwards can uncover hidden assumptions and lead to innovative solutions by focusing directly on the desired end state. As a next step, I will identify a specific problem to apply this method, systematically working backwards from the end goal to understand its implications and potential solutions. I will document the process and outcomes to refine this approach and evaluate its effectiveness across different scenarios.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I am seeking innovative solutions and wish to break free from conventional thinking patterns. This reflects a pattern in my approach where I often explore non-linear or unconventional strategies to gain fresh insights and potentially uncover overlooked opportunities. By consciously recognizing this pattern, I can harness it as a strength, but also remain mindful not to overlook the benefits of traditional methods when they may be more appropriate."
