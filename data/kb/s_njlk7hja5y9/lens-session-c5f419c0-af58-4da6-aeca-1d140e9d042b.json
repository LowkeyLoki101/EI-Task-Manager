  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a challenging situation or decision that I find uncomfortable or overwhelming, such as a conflict at work, a personal relationship issue, or a major life decision. This avoidance could stem from fear of negative outcomes, uncertainty about how to proceed, or a desire to maintain the status quo. Identifying this problem is the first step toward addressing and resolving it.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't as daunting as it seems, and instead represents an opportunity for growth or positive change? By reframing this problem as a potential catalyst for development, I can shift my focus from fear and avoidance to curiosity and proactive engagement. This perspective might help me approach the situation with a mindset geared towards learning and improvement, rather than purely focusing on the potential negatives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, new questions that emerge include: What specific fears or beliefs are causing me to avoid thinking about this problem? How might past experiences be influencing my current avoidance? Additionally, it may be worth exploring what strategies or support systems I can put in place to gradually confront and address this issue. Delving deeper into these areas could provide clarity and actionable steps to tackle the underlying problem more effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding may not be as overwhelming as it initially appears, and addressing it could lead to personal growth. My next step is to identify the specific fears or beliefs that are causing my avoidance and to seek support or strategies that can help me confront the issue. I plan to set aside dedicated time to reflect on this problem and outline small, manageable actions I can take to begin addressing it.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it represents a recurring pattern of avoidance I tend to fall into when faced with difficult situations. This pattern might stem from a fear of failure or conflict, which leads me to procrastinate or ignore the issue rather than confronting it directly. By recognizing this pattern through a meta-lens, I can work towards breaking the cycle by developing strategies to face challenges head-on, such as setting small actionable steps or seeking support from others."
