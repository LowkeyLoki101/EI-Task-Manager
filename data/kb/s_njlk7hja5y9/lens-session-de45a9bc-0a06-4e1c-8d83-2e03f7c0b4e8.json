  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand involves considering a different approach by working backwards from the desired outcome or solution. By framing the problem this way, we can identify the end goal and determine the necessary steps to reach it in reverse order. This method may reveal overlooked steps or assumptions and provide a new perspective that could simplify the path to a solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of solely focusing on reversing the steps from the desired outcome, what if we reframe the problem as an opportunity to explore multiple pathways to reach the same solution? By considering alternative routes and their potential intersections with the backward approach, we may uncover innovative strategies or synergies that were previously hidden. This perspective encourages flexibility and adaptability, allowing for a more dynamic exploration of the problem space.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, new questions arise such as: What assumptions are embedded in the desired outcome? Are there smaller, overlooked components that can be addressed earlier in the process? This backward approach also prompts deeper investigation into the dependencies and prerequisites of each step, encouraging a more thorough understanding of how each stage connects and contributes to the final goal. Exploring these questions can reveal new pathways or solutions that were not initially apparent.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, we can identify overlooked assumptions and dependencies, which may lead to innovative solutions. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work backwards to outline potential steps and alternative pathways. This will help in identifying any hidden opportunities or synergies that could simplify or enhance the solution process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because it allows me to challenge my conventional problem-solving patterns, which often start from the beginning and move linearly towards the end. This pattern of thinking reflects a desire to break free from habitual methods and explore alternative strategies that might lead to more efficient or creative solutions. By questioning my usual approach, I am opening up opportunities for innovation and deeper understanding."
