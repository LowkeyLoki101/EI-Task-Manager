  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a challenging or uncomfortable issue that I have been procrastinating on or ignoring due to its complexity or potential consequences. It could be a personal matter, such as a relationship issue or a health concern, or a professional challenge, like a difficult project or a career decision. Clearly identifying the specific problem is the first step toward addressing it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something daunting or uncomfortable to confront, reframe it as an opportunity for growth and learning. Consider the issue as a puzzle or challenge that, once addressed, could lead to significant personal development or professional advancement. By approaching the problem with curiosity and a positive mindset, it becomes less of a burden and more of a pathway to potential solutions and improvements.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of recursive exploration, consider what underlying fears or beliefs are causing the avoidance of this problem. Ask questions like: Why do I perceive this issue as daunting? What past experiences influence my current hesitation? Additionally, investigate what resources or support systems could aid in addressing this problem effectively, and what smaller, manageable steps could initiate progress in tackling it. This deeper examination could reveal layers of the problem and potential strategies for resolution that weren't initially apparent.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a particular problem due to underlying fears or beliefs about its consequences. The next step is to pinpoint the specific issue, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks, and seek any necessary resources or support. I will set aside dedicated time this week to outline these tasks and begin addressing them one by one, starting with the easiest to build momentum.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this problem avoidance because it is a recurring pattern where I tend to shy away from confronting issues that seem overwhelming or uncomfortable, often due to fear of failure or uncertainty about the outcome. This pattern highlights a need to develop better coping strategies for dealing with complex situations, such as breaking them into smaller, manageable parts or seeking support from others, to avoid procrastination and make progress more effectively. By recognizing this tendency, I can work on altering my approach to challenges, fostering growth and resilience."
