  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding may not be as overwhelming as it initially appears, and addressing it could lead to personal growth. My next step is to identify the specific fears or beliefs that are causing my avoidance and to seek support or strategies that can help me confront the issue.
