  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that would catch me off guard. This involves considering areas where my assumptions or knowledge might be incomplete or biased. Specifically, I need to focus on aspects of my life, work, or environment where surprises could lead to new understanding or growth.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this question by considering not just my current assumptions, but also the blind spots in my emotional or subconscious landscape? Perhaps surprising discoveries could come from exploring hidden biases, unexplored passions, or unrecognized fears. By shifting the focus from external surprises to internal revelations, I might uncover insights that deeply impact my personal growth and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What deeper insights could be gained by exploring the subconscious motivations behind my actions and decisions? How might hidden biases or unrecognized fears shape my responses to certain situations, and what impact would uncovering these have on my personal and professional relationships? Additionally, what unexplored passions might emerge if I actively sought out activities or subjects outside my comfort zone, and how would these discoveries influence my sense of purpose or direction in life?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries are most likely to emerge from introspection and exploring areas outside my usual comfort zone. To act on this, I will commit to journaling regularly to uncover subconscious motivations and biases, and allocate time each week to engage in new activities or learn about unfamiliar subjects. This dual approach aims to reveal internal insights and ignite potential passions that could lead to personal growth.",
