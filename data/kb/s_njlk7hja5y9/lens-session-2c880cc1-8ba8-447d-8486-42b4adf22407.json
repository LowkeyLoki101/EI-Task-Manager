  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves finding a method to integrate an unexpected industry trend with simulation techniques to generate new data. This requires identifying a relevant trend that can be realistically modeled through simulation, and then determining the parameters and variables necessary for the simulation to produce meaningful and applicable data. The goal is to leverage the insights from the trend to enhance data-driven decisions or innovations.",
  "reframeStep": "Consider approaching the problem by viewing the unexpected industry trend not just as a data point to simulate, but as a dynamic catalyst for redefining the simulation's scope and purpose. Instead of merely integrating the trend into existing models, rethink the entire simulation design to explore how this trend could disrupt traditional industry paradigms. By doing so, you could generate fresh data that not only reflects the trend's impact but also reveals new opportunities and risks that might not be apparent from a standard simulation approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, we could explore questions such as: What are the unforeseen consequences of integrating this industry trend into simulations? How might the trend's evolution alter the simulation's relevancy over time? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate how the simulation could adapt to future trends, ensuring that the data remains fresh and applicable. This could involve developing a flexible simulation framework that continuously incorporates new data inputs and recalibrates itself as trends shift.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by designing a flexible simulation framework that integrates unexpected industry trends as dynamic catalysts, we can generate fresh data that uncovers new opportunities and risks. The next step is to identify a specific industry trend and develop a prototype simulation model that incorporates this trend, allowing for continuous recalibration with new data inputs. This will require collaboration with industry experts to ensure the simulation remains relevant and insightful.",
