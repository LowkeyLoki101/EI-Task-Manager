  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is exploring the potential for generating new insights or creative prompts by rearranging existing ones. This involves analyzing how changing the sequence or combination of prompts can lead to novel questions or ideas that might not have been considered previously. The goal is to unlock fresh perspectives or solutions by leveraging the inherent flexibility and randomness in prompt order.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of seeing prompt shuffling as a random act, we considered it a deliberate exercise in pattern recognition and synthesis? By intentionally rearranging prompts, we can uncover underlying themes or connections that were previously obscured. This reframing allows us to approach the exercise not just as a creative spark, but as a strategic tool for discovering hidden insights and fostering deeper understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, we can question how different contexts or fields might interpret or utilize these new emergent prompts. This leads to deeper investigation into the cognitive processes involved in recognizing patterns or drawing connections between seemingly unrelated topics. Additionally, we could explore how different prompts influence creative output in disciplines like writing, design, or problem-solving, potentially leading to research on the impact of randomness and structure in creative thinking processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that deliberately shuffling prompts can reveal new patterns and connections, leading to innovative ideas and insights. The next step is to experiment with rearranging a set of prompts in various ways, documenting any emerging themes or novel questions. This could involve using a specific method for shuffling, such as focusing on thematic similarity or randomness, and then analyzing the outcomes to identify valuable insights or creative directions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because I'm seeking new perspectives and innovative ideas that might not emerge through linear thinking. This approach reflects a pattern of using randomness as a tool for creativity and problem-solving, suggesting a habitual reliance on unconventional methods to break free from cognitive biases or routine thought processes. By examining this behavior, I can consciously harness the power of randomness to strategically enhance my creative and analytical endeavors."
