  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the root of communication inefficiencies lies in the lack of shared understanding and cohesion within the team. As a next step, I will propose a series of team-building activities and workshops focused on fostering open dialogue and mutual clarity. Additionally, I will explore tools and frameworks that can help measure the impact of these activities on team communication and productivity.",
