  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that AI's role in the energy sector will involve a complex interplay of benefits and challenges, rather than a straightforward positive or negative impact. As a next step, I will conduct stakeholder analyses and review historical case studies of technological implementations in the energy sector to better understand potential outcomes and inform adaptive strategies for AI deployment. This approach will help anticipate challenges and leverage AI's full potential effectively.",
