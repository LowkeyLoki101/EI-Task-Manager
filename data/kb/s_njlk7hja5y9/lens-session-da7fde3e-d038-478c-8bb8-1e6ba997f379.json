  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem revolves around uncovering unexpected information or outcomes in a given situation or context. It involves identifying what currently seems unlikely or unforeseen, thereby challenging existing assumptions or beliefs. The goal is to pinpoint areas where surprises could occur, which could lead to new insights or directions.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the question by considering it from the perspective of another person, such as a colleague or a competitor. Instead of focusing on what would surprise you personally, ask, \"What would surprise others if they found it?\" This shift could uncover insights into how others perceive the situation differently, potentially revealing blind spots in your own understanding or highlighting areas where you might have a competitive edge. Additionally, consider what might surprise you not in terms of content, but in terms of the process or method of discoveryâ€”what unconventional approaches could lead to unexpected findings?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively, one might ask: What underlying assumptions are leading to the expectation of surprise? Are there historical or contextual factors that have shaped these assumptions? Additionally, what methodologies or technologies could be employed to systematically uncover surprises? Investigating these areas could provide deeper insights into both the nature of the potential surprises and the processes by which they might be discovered.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from overlooked assumptions or unconventional approaches. The next step is to actively seek out feedback from diverse perspectives, such as colleagues or industry experts, to identify potential blind spots in my current understanding. Additionally, I will explore innovative methodologies or technologies that could reveal unexpected insights, thereby broadening the scope of discovery.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question right now because it challenges my current assumptions and pushes me to explore beyond my comfort zone, potentially leading to innovative insights or solutions. The pattern I'm repeating is one of seeking novelty and surprise to break out of conventional thinking, which can often result in uncovering hidden opportunities or overlooked problems. By stepping back, I can better understand my tendency to focus on the unexpected as a driver for creative problem-solving."
