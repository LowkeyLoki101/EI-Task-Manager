  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying what unexpected discoveries or realizations might catch me off guard in a given context. I see the need to clarify the scope or area of interest where these surprising elements might be found, such as in personal life, work, or a specific project. This involves considering what assumptions I currently hold and what finding would directly challenge or contradict those beliefs.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what unexpected discoveries might surprise you, consider what overlooked opportunities or insights could transform your approach in a particular context. From this angle, the emphasis shifts from surprise to potential growth or innovation, encouraging a mindset of curiosity and exploration rather than guardedness against the unexpected. This reframing compels you to actively seek out areas where you might be missing valuable insights or alternative perspectives that could enhance your understanding or performance.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" could lead to deeper inquiries about personal biases and blind spots. It prompts an exploration into what assumptions or beliefs I hold that might be challenged by new findings. This could warrant further investigation into areas such as cognitive biases, areas of ignorance in my knowledge base, or even the impact of unexpected discoveries on decision-making processes. Additionally, it raises questions about how I can create environments or mindsets that are more conducive to welcoming surprises and integrating them constructively into my understanding.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often lie within areas where my assumptions and biases are strongest. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from diverse perspectives to identify these blind spots. Additionally, I'll explore literature on cognitive bias and decision-making to better understand how unexpected findings can be integrated into my thought processes constructively.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm currently focused on identifying elements in my life or work that could lead to unexpected realizations, which might indicate a pattern of seeking novelty or gaps in my understanding. The pattern I'm repeating is a tendency to anticipate surprises as potential challenges rather than opportunities, which might limit my openness to change. By acknowledging this, I can shift my approach to actively look for new insights that could drive growth, rather than simply avoiding unforeseen disruptions."
