  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a simulation that can generate new, relevant data for our specific needs. We need to determine the type of data we require and the parameters of the simulation that will accurately produce this data. This involves selecting an appropriate model or system to simulate, ensuring it aligns with our objectives and data requirements.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of creating a new simulation from scratch, we looked at existing simulations or models that have been used in similar contexts and adapted them to our needs? This approach could save time and resources by leveraging proven methodologies, while still allowing for customization to fit our specific data requirements. Additionally, exploring collaborations with experts who have experience in running such simulations could provide new insights and ensure more accurate data generation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring existing simulations raises questions about which models have been most effective in similar scenarios and what criteria make them suitable for adaptation. Investigating the potential for integrating machine learning techniques or hybrid models with these simulations could provide deeper insights and more robust data. Additionally, understanding the limitations of current simulations can guide enhancements and innovations, ensuring the new data generated is both reliable and comprehensive for our needs.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that adapting existing simulations used in similar contexts will be more efficient and effective for generating the new data we need. The next step is to conduct a review of existing models and simulations relevant to our field, identifying those with the potential for adaptation. Additionally, I'll seek collaboration with experts who have experience with these models to ensure accuracy and relevance in the data generated.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because generating new data through simulations is crucial for advancing our understanding and decision-making capabilities in our current project. This approach reflects a pattern of seeking innovative solutions by leveraging technology and existing knowledge. By revisiting this thought with a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a tendency to prioritize problem-solving through established frameworks, and this awareness could push me to explore more unconventional or interdisciplinary approaches that might yield even richer data outcomes."
