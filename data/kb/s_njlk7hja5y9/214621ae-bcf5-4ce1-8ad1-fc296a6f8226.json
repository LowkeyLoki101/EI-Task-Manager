  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by designing a flexible simulation framework that integrates unexpected industry trends as dynamic catalysts, we can generate fresh data that uncovers new opportunities and risks. The next step is to identify a specific industry trend and develop a prototype simulation model that incorporates this trend, allowing for continuous recalibration with new data inputs. This will require collaboration with industry experts to ensure the simulation remains relevant and insightful.",
