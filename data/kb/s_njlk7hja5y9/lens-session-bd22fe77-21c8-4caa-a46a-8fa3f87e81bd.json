  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying an overlooked or underexplored pattern in solar technology that could serve as a compelling narrative. This requires analyzing current solar advancements, market trends, or consumer behaviors to uncover a surprising trend or anomaly. The goal is to craft a unique story that both informs and captivates by revealing this hidden aspect of solar technology.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we shift our focus from technological advancements to cultural or societal impacts of solar technology? By exploring how unexpected communities or industries are adapting and integrating solar solutions in innovative ways, we could uncover a story about the transformative socio-economic effects of solar technology. This perspective might reveal untold narratives about resilience, adaptation, or even resistance within different cultural contexts, offering a fresh angle that diverges from typical technology-focused stories.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What societal shifts are being catalyzed by the adoption of solar technology in unexpected regions or demographics? How might this influence local economies, education, or gender roles? Further investigation could delve into how solar technology is reshaping traditional industries or prompting new forms of community collaboration and innovation, potentially uncovering stories of empowerment, cultural renaissance, or unexpected resistance.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that solar technology is quietly transforming societal structures in unexpected regions, leading to shifts in local economies, education, and gender roles. The next step is to research case studies or reports on solar adoption in these areas, focusing on the socio-economic impacts and personal stories of community members. This will provide a foundation for crafting a narrative that highlights both the transformative potential and the nuanced challenges of solar integration in diverse cultural contexts.",
