  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify or develop a simulation that generates new data relevant to our objectives. This involves determining the specific area or variables we want to explore or predict, such as market trends, environmental changes, or human behavior, and then constructing a model that accurately reflects those dynamics. The goal is to produce meaningful insights or predictive analytics that can inform decision-making processes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating a new simulation, consider leveraging existing simulations or models and adapting them to our specific needs. By analyzing and modifying existing frameworks, we can quickly gather insights and identify gaps or opportunities that need a bespoke approach. This perspective emphasizes efficiency, resourcefulness, and the potential for collaborative development with established data sources.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new questions arise regarding the adaptability and scalability of existing simulations to meet our specific needs? How might advancements in AI, such as machine learning techniques, improve the accuracy and reliability of these simulations? Additionally, what ethical considerations should we investigate concerning the data generated and its potential impacts on decision-making processes? Exploring these areas could provide deeper insights and lead to more innovative and responsible simulation applications.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to start by identifying existing simulations that closely align with our objectives and adapt them to our specific context. This approach will allow us to quickly gather preliminary insights and identify any limitations or gaps. The next step is to research available simulation platforms, focusing on those that can be enhanced with AI techniques to improve their adaptability and accuracy, while also considering ethical guidelines for data usage.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am contemplating this because there is a recurring need to generate new data for decision-making, which often leads me to consider developing bespoke simulations. This pattern of thinking may reflect a tendency to prioritize creating novel solutions rather than adapting or enhancing existing tools. By recognizing this, I can consciously shift towards evaluating and iterating on current models, which can save time and resources while still achieving the desired insights."
