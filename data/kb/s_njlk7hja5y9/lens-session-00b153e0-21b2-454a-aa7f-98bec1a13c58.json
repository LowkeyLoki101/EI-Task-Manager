  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying an engaging story hook for marketing content that resonates with today's audience. I see the need to understand current trends, audience interests, and emotional triggers that can capture attention effectively. The goal is to craft a narrative that not only aligns with the brand's message but also stands out in the crowded marketplace.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on finding a trendy story hook, consider reframing the question to explore how your brand's unique story can be integrated into a current trend or cultural moment. This perspective shift encourages leveraging the brand's core values and mission to create a more authentic connection with the audience, rather than solely chasing popular themes. Additionally, think about how your audience can become part of the narrative, turning the story hook into a participatory experience that fosters engagement and loyalty.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the exploration of integrating a brand's unique story with current trends, several questions arise: How can we effectively research and identify trends that align with our brand values? What are the best practices for incorporating audience participation into our narrative? Additionally, deeper investigation could focus on analyzing case studies of successful marketing campaigns that have achieved this integration, providing insights into effective strategies and outcomes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a powerful story hook can be crafted by aligning our brand's unique narrative with a trending cultural moment, while also inviting audience participation to enhance engagement. The next step is to conduct research on current trends and cultural movements that resonate with our brand values, and brainstorm ways to incorporate audience interaction into the story. I will also review successful case studies for inspiration and practical strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying a story hook for marketing content because it's crucial to stay relevant and engage audiences in a competitive market. This reflects a pattern of seeking external validation through trend alignment rather than relying on the inherent strengths and stories of the brand. By stepping back, I can recognize the need to balance trend awareness with authenticity, ensuring the brand's narrative remains consistent and genuine while still capturing current audience interests."
