  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore a problem from a different perspective by starting with the desired outcome and working backward to identify the necessary steps. This approach could reveal overlooked steps or assumptions in the current methodology. By framing the problem backwards, it allows for reverse engineering the process, potentially uncovering new insights or more efficient pathways to the solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the approach as starting from the outcome might emphasize the importance of understanding the end goals deeply before diving into the process. From this perspective, you could see the problem as an opportunity to prioritize what truly matters and eliminate unnecessary steps that donâ€™t directly contribute to reaching the desired result. This angle could also highlight potential bottlenecks or critical points that need more attention, thus streamlining the pathway to success.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards raises new questions such as: What are the critical steps that directly lead to the desired outcome? Are there any assumptions embedded in the current approach that need re-evaluation? This method deserves deeper research into reverse engineering techniques and how they can be applied across different fields to optimize processes and innovate solutions that are not immediately apparent when following traditional forward-thinking methods.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by starting from the desired outcome and working backwards, I can uncover more efficient pathways and identify critical steps that are often overlooked when following a traditional approach. As a next step, I will map out the desired outcome and work backwards to outline the necessary steps, examining each for potential improvements or eliminations. I will also research reverse engineering techniques applicable to this problem to enhance my understanding and application of this approach.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am exploring this backwards approach right now to break out of my usual problem-solving patterns and stimulate creative thinking. This pattern of questioning reveals a tendency to challenge conventional methods, seeking innovation through alternative perspectives. By recognizing this, I can consciously apply such reverse-engineering strategies to other areas, potentially fostering more robust and versatile problem-solving skills across diverse scenarios."
