  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a pattern where people tend to overlook the underlying connections between seemingly unrelated events or ideas. This often results in missed opportunities for innovation or problem-solving. Clearly recognizing and articulating these connections can lead to more effective strategies and insights.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on the connections between events or ideas, we consider the possibility that these patterns are not being missed but are being perceived differently by others due to varied experiences or biases? This shift in perspective suggests that rather than just identifying connections, the key may lie in creating platforms for diverse perspectives to converge, allowing for a richer, more collaborative understanding and approach to innovation and problem-solving.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What tools or methods can be developed to better capture and visualize these underlying connections across seemingly unrelated events or ideas? How can we effectively encourage diverse perspectives to engage in these discussions, ensuring that biases are acknowledged and integrated into collaborative solutions? Additionally, what research can be conducted to understand the cognitive processes behind recognizing these patterns, and how can this knowledge be leveraged to enhance collective problem-solving and innovation?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern of overlooked connections between seemingly unrelated events or ideas is often due to diverse perspectives and biases. The next step is to develop or facilitate platforms and tools that bring together diverse perspectives to collaboratively identify and explore these connections. I will start by researching existing collaborative tools and methodologies that emphasize diverse input and explore how they can be adapted or enhanced to focus on uncovering hidden patterns.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this through a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a recurring pattern in my thinking where I often assume others are missing connections rather than considering that they may have different perspectives due to their unique experiences. This reflection suggests a need to shift my approach from identifying overlooked patterns to facilitating diverse viewpoints and fostering environments where varied insights can be shared and synthesized. This could enhance collaborative problem-solving and innovation by ensuring that all voices are heard and valued."
