  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem-solving approach that flips the usual order of operations. By starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to the present state, I can identify key steps and potential obstacles that might not be obvious when moving forward. This method encourages creative thinking and can reveal hidden insights or alternative paths to the solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as a linear path from start to finish, consider it as a puzzle where you already have the final piece in place. By envisioning the end result and then deconstructing it, you can uncover dependencies and connections that aren't apparent when moving forward. This perspective might highlight redundant steps or reveal opportunities for innovation by focusing on what is truly necessary to reach your goal.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to approaching a problem backwards raises questions about the potential limitations and challenges of this method. What complexities might arise from deconstructing the outcome, and how could these affect the problem-solving process? Additionally, exploring how this approach applies to different types of problems could reveal insights into its broader applicability and effectiveness. Further investigation could focus on case studies where reverse problem-solving has proven successful and areas where it might fall short.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can uncover hidden insights and streamline the problem-solving process by highlighting essential steps and eliminating redundancies. As a next step, I will apply this reverse-engineering approach to a current project, documenting the process to identify any obstacles or innovative solutions that emerge. This will help assess its effectiveness and potential for broader application.",
