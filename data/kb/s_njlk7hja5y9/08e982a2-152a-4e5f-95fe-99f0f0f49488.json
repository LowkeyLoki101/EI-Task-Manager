  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by challenging my current assumptions about my capabilities and limitations, I can uncover deeper, more meaningful questions that drive personal growth. The next step is to engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or seeking feedback from trusted peers, to identify these assumptions and explore how they align with my current priorities and self-perception. This process will help me formulate new questions that lead to actionable insights and growth.",
