  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I notice a recurring pattern where people tend to overlook the underlying causes of recurring issues, focusing instead on superficial symptoms. Many seem to miss the opportunity to address root problems, leading to repeated challenges and inefficiencies. This suggests a need for a more analytical approach to problem-solving, emphasizing deeper investigation and long-term solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the pattern as a missed opportunity for deeper analysis, consider it from the perspective of adaptability and innovation. What if this recurring oversight isn't just a failure to dig deeper, but an opportunity to innovate new methods or practices that inherently prevent these issues from arising in the first place? By shifting focus from problem-solving to problem-prevention, you could pioneer systems that bypass the need for repeated analysis altogether, leading to more sustainable and proactive solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this pattern recursively raises questions about how we can systematically identify and address root causes in varied contexts. It also prompts investigation into methodologies or technologies that enable real-time detection and prevention of these underlying issues. Further research could delve into how different industries successfully implement proactive systems and whether these can be adapted or innovated for broader application, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and foresight in problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring oversight in addressing root causes presents an opportunity to innovate proactive systems that prevent issues before they arise. My next step is to research industries with successful proactive problem-solving frameworks and explore how these can be adapted or improved for broader application. This will involve identifying key elements of these systems and considering how they can be integrated into different contexts to foster a culture of foresight and continuous improvement.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern right now because it reflects a personal inclination towards seeking deeper understanding and sustainable solutions. This approach tends to focus on identifying and resolving root causes rather than just addressing surface-level symptoms. The pattern I'm repeating is one of analytical depth, which may sometimes overlook the potential for innovative, preventive strategies that could streamline processes and reduce the need for continual deep dives."
