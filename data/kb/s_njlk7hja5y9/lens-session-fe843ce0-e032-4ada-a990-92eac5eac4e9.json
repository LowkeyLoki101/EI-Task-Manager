  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that will captivate the target audience and align with the brand's message. I see the need to choose a narrative that resonates emotionally or provides a fresh perspective on a familiar topic to engage and attract potential customers effectively. The goal is to differentiate the content from competitors while still maintaining relevance to current trends and audience interests.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider approaching the story hook by focusing on the audience's current challenges or aspirations rather than just the brand's message. Shift the angle to highlight a story about a customer's transformation or success after using the product or service, tapping into real-life testimonials or case studies. This reframing allows the content to be more relatable and authentic, putting the audience in the center of the narrative and showing how the brand can be a catalyst for positive change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Delve deeper into the types of challenges or aspirations your target audience currently faces. Are there emerging trends or recent events that influence their behavior or preferences? Furthermore, explore various storytelling techniques, such as leveraging multi-platform narratives or interactive content, to engage your audience more effectively and assess how these methods could enhance the story hook's impact.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to create a story hook that centers around a real customer success story, highlighting how they overcame a common challenge using our product or service. The next step is to gather testimonials or case studies from satisfied customers, focusing on recent trends or events that resonate with the target audience. This authentic storytelling approach will be crafted into an engaging narrative across multiple platforms to maximize reach and impact.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because finding a compelling story hook is crucial for creating impactful marketing content that stands out and engages the audience. The pattern I may be repeating is focusing too much on the brand's perspective rather than the audience's needs and experiences. By stepping back, I can ensure my approach is audience-centric, emphasizing authentic narratives that resonate on a personal level."
