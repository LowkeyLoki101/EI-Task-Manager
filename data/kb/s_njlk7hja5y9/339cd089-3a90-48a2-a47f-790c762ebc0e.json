  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a fear of failure or rejection, possibly stemming from past experiences. My next step is to concretely identify this issue by journaling about my avoidance patterns and seeking feedback from a trusted friend or mentor. I'll also outline a small, manageable action I can take this week to begin addressing the issue, such as scheduling that difficult conversation or researching resources that can support me.",
