  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a meaningful question that has been overlooked or neglected in recent times. This involves reflecting on areas of personal or professional life that have not been examined or questioned recently, potentially uncovering insights or opportunities for growth. The goal is to pinpoint a question that can lead to valuable self-reflection or decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "From a completely different perspective, consider reframing the original question to focus on external influences: \"What assumptions am I currently making based on my environment that I haven't questioned in a while?\" By shifting the focus from internal introspection to the external factors shaping your thoughts and actions, you might identify assumptions or biases that have gone unexamined. This approach could reveal new angles for growth by challenging the status quo of your surroundings or interactions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In exploring the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" recursively, consider delving into why certain questions have been neglected. What underlying beliefs or routines are preventing these inquiries from surfacing? Additionally, explore the potential impact of asking these overlooked questions: How might revisiting them alter your current path or mindset? This could lead to a deeper understanding of your priorities and the barriers to addressing them.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are potentially impactful questions related to assumptions and routines that I have not examined recently. My next step is to set aside time for reflection, perhaps journaling or discussing with a trusted mentor, to specifically identify these overlooked questions and the assumptions behind them. This action will help me uncover new insights and opportunities for personal and professional growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this question now because it invites a deeper level of introspection and self-awareness, which is crucial for personal growth. The pattern I might be repeating is the tendency to focus on routine questions or familiar areas of reflection, potentially overlooking less obvious but significant aspects of my life that need attention. By stepping back and questioning my habitual approach, I aim to break free from these patterns and explore new, potentially transformative questions."
