  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is about exploring creativity and generating fresh ideas through the rearrangement of existing prompts. By shuffling these prompts, one can discover new combinations and perspectives that may lead to unexpected insights or innovative questions. The goal is to leverage this method as a tool for enhancing creativity and problem-solving.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider shuffling prompts as a way to challenge existing assumptions and biases. By disrupting the usual order and structure, you not only generate new ideas but also invite a critical examination of your thought patterns. This approach can lead to greater self-awareness and reveal blind spots in your thinking, ultimately enriching both personal growth and creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to determine the most effective prompts when shuffling them, and how might the context or environment influence the outcomes of these newly generated prompts? Additionally, it may be valuable to investigate how this method could be formalized or systematically applied in various fields, such as education or innovation workshops, to enhance creativity and critical thinking.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to the emergence of innovative ideas and perspectives by breaking habitual thought patterns. The next step is to actively implement this method by creating a structured process for shuffling prompts, perhaps using a digital tool or randomizer, and applying it to specific projects or brainstorming sessions. This approach can be further tested and refined to optimize its effectiveness in various contexts, such as education or creative workshops.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about shuffling prompts, I'm currently exploring the broader theme of creativity and innovation in problem-solving. This approach of rearranging existing elements reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and breaking out of habitual thinking. It highlights an ongoing pursuit of self-discovery and a desire to challenge conventional thought processes to uncover fresh insights and ideas."
