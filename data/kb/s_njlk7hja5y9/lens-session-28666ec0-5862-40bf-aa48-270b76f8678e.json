  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a meaningful question that hasn't been considered recently, which might unlock new insights or perspectives in my life. This involves reflecting on areas of personal development, relationships, career, or hobbies that may have been overlooked. The goal is to surface these neglected areas and explore them to foster growth or solve underlying issues.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the focus shifts from identifying a question to exploring why certain areas have been overlooked in the first place? By examining the reasons behind neglecting specific aspects of life, such as avoidance, discomfort, or lack of awareness, new insights might emerge. This approach could lead to a deeper understanding of personal priorities and barriers, ultimately uncovering more meaningful questions to address.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying beliefs or assumptions have prevented me from asking certain questions? How might exploring these assumptions lead to a better understanding of my motivations and priorities? Additionally, how can I regularly evaluate and adjust my focus to ensure I'm not neglecting important areas of my life in the future? These inquiries could warrant deeper research into personal reflection techniques or cognitive biases that influence question-asking habits.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that exploring the reasons behind neglecting certain areas in my life will help uncover meaningful questions that need addressing. As a next step, I will set aside dedicated time for reflection to examine these neglected areas, focusing on underlying beliefs and assumptions that might have prevented me from asking pertinent questions. Additionally, I will research personal reflection techniques to regularly evaluate and adjust my focus, ensuring a balanced approach to personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because there's a desire to challenge complacency and spark growth by uncovering overlooked areas of life. This pattern of seeking new questions might stem from a habitual drive to self-improve or a fear of stagnation. By stepping back, I can examine whether this approach actually leads to meaningful insights or if it's simply a routine I follow without clear intention."
