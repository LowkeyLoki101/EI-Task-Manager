  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation to generate new data for analysis or insight. I see a need to determine the type of data required and the parameters of a simulation model that can produce this data. This involves specifying the context or system we wish to simulate and understanding the desired outcomes or insights from the generated data.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on running a simulation to create new data, consider exploring existing datasets that might already provide the insights needed. This approach could involve leveraging open data sources or collaborating with other organizations to access relevant data. By reframing the problem, you might discover that synthesizing and analyzing existing data can be more efficient and effective than generating new data from a simulation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What types of simulations are most relevant to our field or industry, and how can they be adapted or developed to meet our specific data needs? What are the potential limitations or biases inherent in these simulations, and how might they affect the generated data? Additionally, how can we validate the accuracy and applicability of the data produced by these simulations compared to real-world scenarios or existing datasets?",
  "closureStep": "Given the exploration of alternative approaches and considerations, the next step is to conduct a review of existing datasets or simulations relevant to our industry to determine if they can meet our data needs. If existing data is insufficient, outline a plan to develop a custom simulation model, ensuring it incorporates necessary variables and addresses potential biases. This plan will include defining specific objectives, parameters, and validation methods to ensure the generated data is both accurate and applicable.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this question because there's a perceived need for new data to gain insights or support decision-making. The pattern here is an inclination towards generating data through simulations rather than initially exploring existing resources. This approach could be limiting, as it overlooks potentially valuable data that is already available and ready to be analyzed, which could save time and resources."
