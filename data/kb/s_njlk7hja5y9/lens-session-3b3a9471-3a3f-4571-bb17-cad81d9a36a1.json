  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a potential story hook in exploring how solar technology is unexpectedly advancing in areas with traditionally low sunlight exposure, such as regions known for heavy cloud cover or high latitudes. This could reveal innovative uses of solar technology that defy conventional expectations, highlighting how advancements in solar efficiency and adaptability are enabling broader geographical applications. This surprising pattern could serve as a fresh angle to engage audiences interested in renewable energy and technological innovation.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the exploration of solar technology by focusing on how unexpected social or cultural shifts are driving the adoption of solar solutions in unconventional communities, such as urban centers prioritizing vertical solar installations or indigenous communities integrating traditional practices with modern solar tech. This angle highlights the intersection of technology with societal changes, offering a narrative on how diverse groups are innovatively using solar power to meet their unique needs and environmental challenges.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "A recursive exploration could involve investigating the long-term impacts of solar technology in areas with traditionally low solar exposure: How are these communities adapting their infrastructure to maximize solar gains, and what unforeseen environmental or economic benefits are emerging? Additionally, examining the cultural implications of solar adoption in these regions could uncover stories about shifts in community identity and resilience. Further research could delve into how these changes influence local policies and inspire broader global trends in renewable energy usage.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising advancements in solar technology are driving adoption in unexpected geographic and cultural areas, revealing innovative uses and broader implications. The next step is to conduct interviews with experts and community leaders in these regions to gather firsthand insights and stories. This research will help shape a compelling narrative that highlights the transformative impact of solar technology beyond traditional expectations.",
