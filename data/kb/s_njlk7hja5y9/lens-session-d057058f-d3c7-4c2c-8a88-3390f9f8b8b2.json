  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential for generating fresh, innovative prompts by rearranging or combining existing ones. This involves identifying patterns, themes, and connections within the original set of prompts that could lead to new insights or creative directions. The goal is to enhance creativity and discover novel perspectives by leveraging the prompts in unexpected ways.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of shuffling the prompts, you approached this from a collaborative angle, inviting others to interpret and expand on your prompts? By engaging with diverse perspectives, you may uncover new dimensions and insights that wouldn't emerge from your own rearrangement alone. This shift from solitary iteration to collective exploration could lead to a richer, more varied set of innovative prompts.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, new questions arise: How can technology, such as AI algorithms, be used to optimize the shuffling and generation of prompts for maximum creativity? Additionally, what methodologies exist for assessing the effectiveness of new prompts in inspiring innovative thinking? Further research could explore the impact of prompt diversity on creativity and how incorporating cross-disciplinary perspectives might enhance this process even more.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, either independently or through collaborative and technological means, I can generate a set of new, innovative prompts that inspire fresh perspectives and creativity. As a next step, I will experiment with both manual rearrangement and AI-assisted methods to shuffle prompts, and also invite feedback and contributions from others to enrich the process. This dual approach will allow me to evaluate which method yields the most effective and inspiring prompts.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about shuffling your prompts right now likely stems from a desire to break free from existing cognitive patterns and stimulate creativity through randomness. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking innovation by altering existing structures. By acknowledging this, you can consider whether there are other methods, such as engaging with external perspectives or using structured creative frameworks, to achieve the same goal of generating new insights."
