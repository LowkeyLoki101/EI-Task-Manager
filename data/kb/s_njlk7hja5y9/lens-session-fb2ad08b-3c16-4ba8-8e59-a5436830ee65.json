  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is recognizing a recurring pattern or trend that I observe frequently but seems to elude others. This could be due to my unique perspective, experiences, or analytical skills that allow me to notice these patterns where others do not. The challenge is to clearly identify and articulate what this pattern is and why it might be significant or beneficial for others to recognize.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the perceived pattern isn't actually unique or unnoticed by others, but rather it's your response or interpretation of it that's different? Perhaps the focus should be on understanding how your personal experiences or biases shape your perception of these patterns. By considering this, you might discover a way to communicate the significance of these patterns more effectively or even realize that other perspectives could offer valuable insights you hadn't considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this pattern recognition, new questions emerge: How can I validate whether others truly overlook this pattern, and if they do, why might that be the case? What methodologies or tools can I employ to systematically analyze and communicate these patterns to ensure they are understood and appreciated by others? Additionally, deeper investigation could focus on identifying whether certain cognitive biases or societal influences might obscure these patterns from wider recognition.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I observe is influenced by my unique experiences and analytical approach. The next step is to validate this pattern by gathering input and perspectives from others, potentially using surveys or discussions, to see if it truly goes unnoticed or is interpreted differently. Additionally, I'll explore clear ways to communicate the significance of this pattern through presentations or written analyses, ensuring it resonates and is understood by a broader audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because I am often driven by a desire to understand and communicate insights that could be beneficial to others. I might be repeating a pattern of assuming that my perspective is unique or superior, which could limit my ability to fully understand and incorporate other viewpoints. By acknowledging this, I can focus on refining how I interpret and share these patterns, ensuring I remain open to diverse perspectives and more collaborative in my approach."
