  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an assumption that may be flawed, which involves scrutinizing beliefs or perspectives that are taken for granted without evidence. The challenge lies in critically evaluating these assumptions to determine their validity and potential impact on decisions or outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a potentially wrong assumption, consider approaching the situation by exploring what different assumptions or perspectives others might hold. By shifting the focus from self-scrutiny to understanding diverse viewpoints, you might uncover overlooked insights or alternative approaches that could enrich your understanding and decision-making process. This perspective encourages open-mindedness and a broader evaluation of the context.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this trigger further, one might ask: What specific evidence or experiences led to this assumption in the first place, and how might they be re-evaluated? Additionally, it could be valuable to investigate how this assumption interacts with other beliefs or assumptionsâ€”are there any interconnected assumptions that should also be reconsidered? Delving deeper, consider how updating or discarding this assumption could impact other areas of thought or decision-making, potentially leading to broader shifts in understanding or behavior.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current assumption might be based on outdated information or a narrow perspective. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from others with diverse experiences or expertise to challenge and potentially refine my assumption. Additionally, I will review recent data or research to ensure my assumptions align with current evidence and consider conducting a small experiment to test the validity of my assumption in a practical setting.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying potentially wrong assumptions right now because I often rely on established beliefs or perspectives without questioning their validity, which can lead to blind spots in my decision-making. This reflects a pattern of seeking certainty and validation rather than embracing uncertainty and diverse viewpoints. By recognizing this tendency, I can consciously work towards incorporating a broader range of perspectives, thus enhancing my critical thinking and adaptability."
