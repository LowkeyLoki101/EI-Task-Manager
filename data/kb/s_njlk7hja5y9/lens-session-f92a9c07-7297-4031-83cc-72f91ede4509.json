  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore what fresh insights or creative questions might arise from rearranging existing prompts in a new order. By shuffling the prompts, there's potential to uncover previously unseen connections or themes, sparking innovative thinking and offering new perspectives. This approach challenges the conventional order and encourages a dynamic exploration of ideas.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the prompts themselves, you consider the process of shuffling as a metaphor for flexibility and adaptability in your thinking? From this perspective, the act of shuffling becomes an exercise in letting go of rigid structures and embracing uncertainty. This shift in focus might reveal new approaches to problem-solving, highlighting the importance of adaptability in generating innovative ideas.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, consider questions like: What patterns or themes consistently emerge when shuffling prompts, and how can these inform the creation of new prompts? What impact does the frequency or method of shuffling have on the quality and originality of the new ideas generated? Further investigation could explore the psychological effects of randomization in creative processes, or how different shuffling techniques might optimize creative output in various contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to unexpected connections and innovative ideas by breaking habitual thought patterns. As a next step, I will experiment with different methods of randomizing my prompts, such as using a random number generator or physically reordering them, to observe what novel insights or questions arise. I will also document the themes and patterns that consistently emerge from these shuffles to refine my approach to creative thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts now to challenge my habitual ways of processing information and to break free from routine patterns of thought. This exercise reflects a broader pattern of seeking novelty and adaptability in problem-solving, highlighting my ongoing desire to embrace uncertainty and explore varied perspectives. By stepping back and examining this process, I can better understand how flexibility and openness to change contribute to innovative thinking."
