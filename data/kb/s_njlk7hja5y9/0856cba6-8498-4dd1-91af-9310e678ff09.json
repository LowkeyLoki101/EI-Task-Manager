  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that procrastination is a signal of deeper issues, such as fear of failure or lack of motivation. My next step is to identify specific tasks I tend to procrastinate on and analyze why they trigger avoidance. By understanding these patterns, I can develop targeted strategies to address the root causes, such as setting smaller, manageable goals or seeking support to overcome fears, ultimately improving my productivity and well-being.",
