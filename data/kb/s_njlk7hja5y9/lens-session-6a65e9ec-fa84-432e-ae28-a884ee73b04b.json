  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves considering a situation from a reverse perspective. By approaching the problem backwards, you focus on the desired end result first and work your way back to the starting point. This method can reveal overlooked steps, assumptions, or dependencies that might be critical to achieving the desired outcome. It allows for a fresh perspective that can uncover new solutions or highlight potential obstacles that may not have been evident with a forward approach.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of solely focusing on the end result, what if we reframed the approach to consider the journey itself and the milestones along the way? By examining each step needed to reach the end goal in reverse order, we could identify not only the necessary actions but also the skills, resources, and potential challenges that arise at each point. This perspective might shift the emphasis from simply solving the problem to optimizing the process and ensuring continuous progress and learning throughout.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively applying the backward approach, new questions might emerge such as: What are the specific milestones or checkpoints that indicate progress when working backwards? How might this reverse approach change our understanding of the initial assumptions or starting conditions? Further investigation could explore how different disciplines or industries successfully utilize reverse engineering or backward design principles, and what best practices can be adapted to the current problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will illuminate crucial steps and dependencies that may not have been apparent initially. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work in reverse to identify each necessary action and potential obstacle. I'll then compare this reverse mapping with the forward approach to refine the strategy and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, I'm engaging in a pattern of seeking deeper understanding and innovation through unconventional methods. This reflects a desire to challenge standard procedures and explore alternative pathways to problem-solving. By consciously choosing a reverse approach, I'm likely aiming to break free from linear thinking, allowing for creative insights and potential breakthroughs in tackling the issue at hand."
