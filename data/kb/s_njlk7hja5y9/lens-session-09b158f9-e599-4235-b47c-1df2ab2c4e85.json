  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The pattern I keep seeing is a recurring issue or trend that consistently emerges within a specific context or environment, but it seems to go unnoticed by others. This could involve inefficiencies in a process, emerging market trends, or behavioral patterns in team dynamics. Identifying this pattern can lead to innovative solutions or improvements that others might overlook.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the pattern from another angle, consider the possibility that what seems like inefficiency or a missed trend to me might actually be a strategic choice by those involved, based on information or constraints I am unaware of. Alternatively, the pattern might be a reflection of deeper systemic issues that aren't easily addressed, suggesting a need for broader collaboration or a shift in perspective to fully understand and tackle the root causes. This approach encourages questioning assumptions and seeking more comprehensive insights before proposing solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions arise: What underlying factors contribute to the recurring pattern I observe? Could there be historical or contextual elements that perpetuate this pattern, and how might they be influencing current perceptions and decisions? Additionally, what are the potential impacts or missed opportunities if this pattern goes unaddressed, and how can I gather more data or insights to better understand and communicate its significance to others? These questions warrant deeper investigation and research to uncover the roots and broader implications of the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring pattern might be a result of overlooked inefficiencies or emerging trends that others are not prioritizing due to lack of awareness or different strategic focuses. The next step is to gather more data to substantiate this pattern and engage with stakeholders to share insights and explore collaborative solutions. I will schedule a meeting to discuss these findings and propose a small pilot project to test potential improvements or innovations based on the identified pattern.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern right now because I'm driven by a desire to improve processes and uncover overlooked opportunities, which is a recurring theme in my approach to problem-solving. This pattern might reflect a tendency to assume that others are missing something, rather than considering that their perspectives or strategic insights differ from mine. By recognizing this, I can focus on fostering open communication and collaboration to gain a more holistic understanding before concluding that a pattern is being overlooked."
