  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is a task or decision that feels overwhelming, but by reframing it as an opportunity for growth, I can approach it more positively. My next step is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and set a specific time to address the first part, which will make the issue seem less daunting and more actionable. This approach will help me build momentum and gradually tackle the problem while learning and growing from the experience.",
