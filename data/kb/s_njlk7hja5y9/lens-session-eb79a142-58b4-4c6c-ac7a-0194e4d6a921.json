  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of an assumption I currently hold. The assumption might be influencing my decisions or perspectives, potentially leading to errors or missed opportunities. It's important to clearly identify this assumption and evaluate its basis to ensure my understanding and actions are aligned with reality.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on identifying a potentially wrong assumption, I consider which assumptions are most critical to the outcomes I desire? By shifting from questioning the validity of an assumption to evaluating its impact, I can prioritize which assumptions to scrutinize first. This approach might reveal not just errors, but also opportunities for improvement or innovation in how I approach a situation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the assumptions underlying the process of identifying potentially wrong assumptions? Are there specific cognitive biases or blind spots that could influence my analysis of these assumptions? Additionally, how might questioning assumptions lead to broader insights about my decision-making framework or the systems I operate within? Investigating these areas could uncover deeper layers of understanding and potential areas for growth or innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on identifying and evaluating the most critical assumptions impacting my desired outcomes, I can better prioritize my efforts and uncover both errors and opportunities for improvement. The next step is to list my key assumptions related to a specific decision or project, rank them by their potential impact, and then critically assess their validity and implications. This approach will guide my actions towards more informed and strategic decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about questioning assumptions right now because it can reveal blind spots in my understanding and improve decision-making. This pattern of introspection is part of a broader approach to ensure accuracy and adaptability in my thinking. By consistently examining assumptions, I can cultivate a mindset that is both critical and open to change, allowing for more strategic and informed actions."
