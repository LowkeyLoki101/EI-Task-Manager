  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is understanding the potential outcomes and implications of tackling an issue in reverse order. By approaching the problem backwards, I might gain new insights or identify overlooked steps that could lead to a different solution. The goal is to uncover alternative pathways or solutions by reversing the conventional order of analysis or action.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the problem itself, consider starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to identify the necessary steps to get there. This perspective shift emphasizes the end goal and could reveal dependencies or priorities that may not be obvious when tackling the problem in a forward sequence. By envisioning the reverse path, you might also expose hidden assumptions or constraints that need to be addressed to achieve success.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, new questions arise: What are the specific outcomes I want to achieve, and how do they align with my initial assumptions? What hidden dependencies might emerge if I start at the end and work backwards? This strategy deserves deeper investigation, such as analyzing successful case studies where reverse engineering led to innovative solutions and identifying industries or fields where reverse problem-solving has been effectively applied.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards could reveal critical insights into the dependencies and priorities necessary to achieve the desired outcome. The next step is to clearly define the desired outcome and map out the sequence of steps needed to reach it in reverse order. This approach will involve reviewing case studies or examples where reverse engineering has been successful, to identify effective strategies and potential pitfalls.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because it challenges my typical problem-solving approach and pushes me to think creatively. This pattern of reversing the order could indicate a desire for deeper understanding or a need to break out of conventional thinking patterns. By consistently seeking alternative perspectives, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and uncover innovative solutions that might not be apparent through traditional methods."
