  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see a need to identify a simulation model that can generate new, relevant data for analysis or decision-making. The problem requires selecting a simulation type that aligns with our objectives, such as a Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment or an agent-based model for understanding complex systems. The focus should be on determining the specific outcomes we want from the simulation to guide the choice of methodology.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on selecting a simulation model, we considered collaborating with experts in data science or simulation to co-create a bespoke simulation tailored to our unique needs? This approach could introduce new perspectives and innovative techniques that we might not have considered, potentially leading to more robust and insightful data generation. Additionally, exploring partnerships with academic institutions or tech companies could provide access to cutting-edge simulation tools and methodologies.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, we should ask what specific variables or factors need to be included in the simulation to ensure it accurately represents the system or scenario we're studying. Additionally, we should consider what validation methods will be employed to ensure the simulation's outputs are reliable and credible. It may also be worthwhile to explore if iterative cycles of simulation and real-world testing could refine the model and enhance its predictive capabilities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to pursue a collaboration with data science experts or academic institutions to design a bespoke simulation model tailored to our specific objectives. As a next step, I'll reach out to potential partners and initiate discussions to explore collaborative opportunities. Additionally, I'll define the key variables and intended outcomes to guide the development and validation of the simulation model.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's a need to generate new data to support our analysis or decision-making processes. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing primarily on the technical aspect of selecting a simulation model without considering broader strategic collaborations or innovative approaches. This reflective step could help me recognize the value of integrating external expertise and diverse perspectives to enhance the effectiveness of our data generation efforts."
