  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential for innovation and creativity by rearranging the structure of existing prompts. By shuffling these prompts, the goal is to discover fresh perspectives or ideas that might not have been evident in their original sequence. This approach encourages looking at familiar concepts in new ways, potentially leading to unexpected insights or solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from a different perspective, consider viewing the act of shuffling prompts not just as a tool for innovation, but as a method for uncovering latent themes or connections between ideas that might have been overlooked. This approach could also be seen as a way to break out of cognitive biases or patterns that have developed over time, allowing for a reset of creative thinking processes. By thinking of shuffling as a diagnostic tool, it becomes a means of evaluating the flexibility and adaptability of one's thought processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise such as: How might the shuffled prompts reveal underlying patterns or biases in my original thinking? What methods can be employed to systematically analyze and categorize the outcomes of these shuffled prompts for further study? Additionally, it might be worthwhile to investigate the impact of prompt shuffling in collaborative environments to see if it fosters more diverse and inclusive idea generation. These inquiries could lead to deeper research into the psychological and cognitive effects of randomness on creativity.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can uncover hidden connections and inspire novel ideas. The next step is to implement a systematic approach to shuffling and analyzing these prompts, perhaps using a software tool or algorithm to ensure randomness and track outcomes. Additionally, I will explore the effects of this exercise in a group setting to evaluate its potential for enhancing collaborative creativity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now to actively challenge my cognitive routines and explore new avenues of creativity. This approach reflects a broader pattern of seeking innovation through disruption and variability, which is a technique I often employ to stimulate fresh thinking and avoid stagnation. By consciously altering familiar patterns, I'm attempting to foster adaptability and uncover hidden connections that could lead to breakthrough ideas."
