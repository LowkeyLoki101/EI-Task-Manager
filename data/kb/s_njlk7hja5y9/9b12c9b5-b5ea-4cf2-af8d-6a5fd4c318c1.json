  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the focus on large, immediate changes often overshadows the importance of small, incremental adjustments, which collectively drive significant improvements over time. To address this, my next step will be to conduct research on cognitive and cultural biases in decision-making, focusing on how these biases impact the perception and implementation of incremental changes. Additionally, I'll explore strategies to better identify and leverage these subtle shifts for strategic advantage within organizations.",
