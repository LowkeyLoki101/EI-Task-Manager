  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to identify a simulation that can generate new, useful data. I see a need to first determine the specific type of data or insights required, as this will guide the choice of simulation. Clearly defining the objective will help in selecting the most appropriate simulation model to use.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on simulations, consider exploring alternative methods like data augmentation, using existing datasets to extrapolate new insights, or employing machine learning models to predict or infer missing data. From a different perspective, collaborating with domain experts to crowdsource data or insights could also be a viable approach to generating new, relevant data. This reframing shifts the focus from creating data through simulations to leveraging a variety of methods and resources for data generation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific types of simulations are most effective in generating the desired data, and what existing frameworks or tools can be leveraged for this purpose? Additionally, how do simulations compare with other data generation methods in terms of reliability, cost, and scalability? Exploring these questions could lead to deeper research into the effectiveness and feasibility of different simulation models and methodologies, as well as their integration with alternative data generation approaches.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that simulations should be selected based on the specific type of data needed and the context in which it will be used. My next step is to clearly define the objectives and data requirements by consulting with stakeholders or domain experts. Following this, I will research existing simulation frameworks and tools that align with these objectives, while also considering alternative data generation methods to ensure the most efficient and effective approach is chosen.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's a recurring pattern of relying on simulations as the primary method for generating new data. This approach might signify a tendency to favor computational and model-based solutions over exploring diverse methodologies. By examining this pattern, I can consciously broaden my approach, incorporating alternative strategies such as data augmentation or collaboration with experts, to enrich the data generation process."
