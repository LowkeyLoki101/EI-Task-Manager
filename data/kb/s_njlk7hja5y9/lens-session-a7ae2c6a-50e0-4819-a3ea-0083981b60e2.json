  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new, relevant data for our needs. The focus is on selecting a simulation that aligns with our objectives, data requirements, and available resources to ensure the results are actionable and beneficial. The key is to define the parameters and scope of the simulation clearly to produce meaningful and usable data outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on selecting a simulation, consider approaching the problem from the perspective of collaboration. What if you engaged with experts or stakeholders in your field to co-create the simulation parameters and objectives? This could lead to innovative ideas and insights that might not surface when working in isolation, ultimately generating more comprehensive and diverse data.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific challenges or gaps in our current data could a simulation help address, and how could this influence the design of the simulation? How can we ensure that the simulation's parameters are flexible enough to adapt to new insights or data requirements that may arise during the process? Additionally, what are the potential impacts of the simulated data on decision-making processes, and how might we validate the simulation's results to ensure their reliability and relevance?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that engaging with experts and stakeholders will help co-create a simulation that addresses current data gaps and meets our objectives. The next step is to organize a workshop or meeting with these collaborators to define the simulation's parameters and objectives, ensuring they are flexible enough to adapt to new insights. This collaborative approach will enhance the reliability and relevance of the simulated data for our decision-making processes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because generating new data through simulations is crucial for advancing our research and decision-making processes. The pattern I'm repeating is approaching the problem from a technical standpoint without considering the broader context of collaboration and interdisciplinary input. By stepping back and engaging with others, I can enrich the simulation design, ensuring it aligns better with diverse needs and perspectives, ultimately leading to more robust and applicable data."
