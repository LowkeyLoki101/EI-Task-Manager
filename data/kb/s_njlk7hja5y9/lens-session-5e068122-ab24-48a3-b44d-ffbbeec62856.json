  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem to address is identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that captures attention and engages the audience effectively today. This involves understanding the target audience's current interests and trends, and crafting a narrative that resonates with them emotionally or intellectually. The goal is to create a memorable and shareable piece that aligns with both audience desires and brand messaging.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the question, consider looking at the story hook from the perspective of the brand's unique value proposition rather than starting with audience trends. What if the hook was centered around a distinctive feature or benefit of the product or service that solves a pressing problem for the audience? By highlighting a unique aspect of the offering itself, you might uncover a fresh angle that naturally aligns with audience interests, creating an authentic and compelling narrative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In exploring this further, consider how emerging technologies like AI or augmented reality could be integrated into your marketing story to enhance engagement and interactivity. Additionally, investigate how the story hook can be adapted to different platforms, ensuring it resonates across various media channels. This could also prompt research into how audience feedback can be leveraged to iteratively refine the narrative, making it increasingly relevant and impactful over time.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to focus the story hook on a unique feature of the product or service that directly addresses a pressing audience need. I will integrate emerging technologies, such as AI, to create an interactive and engaging narrative. The next step is to test this narrative across different platforms and gather audience feedback to refine the content, ensuring it resonates effectively and remains relevant.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because creating effective marketing content is essential for engaging the audience and driving brand success. A pattern I might be repeating is focusing primarily on audience trends and interests without first considering the unique aspects of the brand itself. By shifting my approach to start with the brand's distinctive features, I can create more authentic and differentiated content that still aligns with what the audience values."
