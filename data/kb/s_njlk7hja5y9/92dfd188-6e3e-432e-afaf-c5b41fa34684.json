  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my prompts, I can gain insights into my cognitive patterns and biases, uncovering potential areas for innovative questioning and thought diversity. The next step is to systematically shuffle and analyze my prompts to identify recurring themes or ideas, which could then be used to develop a framework for generating more varied and creative questions in future brainstorming sessions. This practice could enhance my ability to approach problems from multiple angles, leading to more comprehensive solutions.",
