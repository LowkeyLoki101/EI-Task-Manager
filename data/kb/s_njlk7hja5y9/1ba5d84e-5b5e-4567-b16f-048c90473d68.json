  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling prompts, we can uncover new connections and themes that catalyze creative thinking. The next step is to actively engage in this exercise by randomly rearranging a set of prompts and documenting any novel insights or questions that arise. This process should be repeated multiple times to observe patterns and refine the approach to leveraging prompt shuffling as a tool for creativity.",
