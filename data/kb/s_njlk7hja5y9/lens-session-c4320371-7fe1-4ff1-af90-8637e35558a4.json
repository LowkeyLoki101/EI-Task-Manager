  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could arise in a given context. This involves exploring situations or environments where surprise elements might be overlooked or not anticipated. Clearly defining what constitutes a \"surprise\" can help in setting parameters to recognize these unexpected findings.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we considered the perspective of someone else discovering surprising elements in our environment? This could shift the focus from personal biases and blind spots to more diverse viewpoints, potentially unveiling surprises we might not notice ourselves. By examining what would surprise others, we might uncover new insights about our own contexts that we hadn't previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to further questions about the underlying assumptions and biases that shape our understanding of surprises. For instance, what cognitive biases might be influencing our expectations, and how do these biases vary across different cultures or disciplines? Additionally, exploring how technology or new methodologies might reveal unexpected findings in familiar contexts could deserve deeper investigation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by intentionally seeking diverse perspectives and utilizing new methodologies, we could uncover surprising elements that are often obscured by our own cognitive biases. As a next step, I will actively engage with individuals from different cultural or disciplinary backgrounds to gather their insights on familiar contexts, and experiment with new technologies or analytical tools to identify unexpected findings. This approach should help broaden my understanding and potentially reveal surprises I hadn't previously considered.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking to uncover unexpected insights or elements in my environment that could provide value or shift my understanding. The pattern I'm repeating is focusing on my own perspective, which might limit the surprises I can identify. By stepping back, I can challenge this approach and consider incorporating diverse viewpoints, which can help in recognizing surprises that are not immediately apparent to me."
