  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying the assumptions being made about AI's role in the energy sector and understanding the implications of reversing these assumptions. Specifically, the assumption might be that AI will always lead to efficiency and cost reduction. If we consider the reverse—that AI could lead to inefficiencies or increased costs due to unforeseen complexities or implementation challenges—this could significantly alter strategic planning and risk management approaches within the sector.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from another angle, consider the assumption that AI in the energy sector is primarily about technological advancement. What if, instead, we view AI as a catalyst for cultural or organizational change? This shift in perspective could lead to outcomes where the success of AI implementation is more dependent on human factors, such as employee adaptability and leadership buy-in, rather than just technical prowess. This could change the focus of strategic planning to include comprehensive training programs and change management strategies.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive implications of reversing assumptions about AI in the energy sector raises new questions: How might the energy sector adapt if AI implementation leads to increased complexity and costs? What new skills or knowledge would be necessary for employees to manage such outcomes effectively? Further investigation could focus on real-world case studies where AI adoption led to unexpected challenges, analyzing the factors that contributed to these outcomes and the strategies employed to overcome them.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the assumption of AI always leading to increased efficiency in the energy sector might overlook potential complexities and costs. To address this, I will research case studies where AI implementation in energy led to unexpected challenges, focusing on the strategies used to mitigate these issues. Additionally, I will explore training programs that prepare employees for the organizational changes AI might bring.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because AI's role in the energy sector is a critical point of consideration for future strategic planning and innovation. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing primarily on the technological aspects of AI without fully considering the broader implications, such as cultural shifts and human factors, which are equally critical to the successful integration of AI solutions. Recognizing this pattern can help me adopt a more holistic approach that balances both technical and human elements in strategic decision-making."
