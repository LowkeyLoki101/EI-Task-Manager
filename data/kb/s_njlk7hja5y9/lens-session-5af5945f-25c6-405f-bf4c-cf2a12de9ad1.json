  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is determining what kind of simulation can be run to generate new, useful data. We need to identify the specific objective of the data collection and the variables involved, so we can choose or design a simulation model that accurately reflects the real-world scenario we are interested in. This involves understanding the context and constraints to ensure the simulation yields relevant and actionable insights.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what simulation to run, consider what real-world scenarios or experiments you can simulate virtually to gather new insights. By shifting the perspective from the tool to the outcome, you can prioritize simulations that explore uncharted scenarios or test hypotheses that are otherwise difficult or costly to experiment with in the real world. This approach emphasizes the potential of simulations to uncover novel data and unexpected patterns by exploring scenarios that extend beyond current knowledge and constraints.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific real-world scenarios or hypotheses are currently lacking sufficient data, and how might simulating these scenarios provide new insights? Additionally, what are the limitations and assumptions of existing simulation models, and how can we refine them to better capture complex systems or variables that are often overlooked? These questions could lead to a deeper understanding of where simulations can most effectively generate novel data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying specific real-world scenarios or hypotheses that lack sufficient data, we can design simulations to address these gaps. The next step is to conduct a needs assessment to determine which areas are most critical for exploration and then develop or adapt simulation models that can effectively generate the desired data. This approach ensures that our simulations are both purposeful and aligned with broader research or business objectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there is a need to generate new data that can inform decision-making or enhance understanding of a particular issue. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking innovative solutions or insights through simulation, indicating an underlying drive to leverage technology for exploration and problem-solving. By recognizing this pattern, I can ensure that my approach remains aligned with strategic objectives and not merely focused on the novelty of simulation itself."
