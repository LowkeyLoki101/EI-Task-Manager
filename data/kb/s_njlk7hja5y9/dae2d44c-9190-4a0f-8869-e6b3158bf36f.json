  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, we can identify overlooked assumptions and dependencies, which may lead to innovative solutions. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work backwards to outline potential steps and alternative pathways. This will help in identifying any hidden opportunities or synergies that could simplify or enhance the solution process.",
