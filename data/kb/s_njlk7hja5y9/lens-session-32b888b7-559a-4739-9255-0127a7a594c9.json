  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem revolves around identifying potentially incorrect assumptions that may be influencing decision-making or understanding of a situation. The focus is on questioning and evaluating these assumptions to ensure they are based on accurate information and reasoning. This involves scrutinizing beliefs or premises that have been taken for granted, to uncover any that might be flawed or unsupported by evidence.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, you considered how these assumptions shape your perspective and decision-making? By examining the influence of these assumptions, you might uncover new insights or alternative approaches that could lead to more innovative or effective solutions. Additionally, approaching the situation with curiosity rather than skepticism could foster a more open-minded exploration of possibilities, ultimately enhancing your understanding and adaptability.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively leads to asking: \"What are the origins of these assumptions, and how have they been reinforced over time?\" Additionally, it prompts further investigation into how these assumptions impact other areas of thinking or decision-making. This could involve researching cognitive biases, examining historical decision patterns, or seeking diverse perspectives to challenge entrenched beliefs, thus deepening the understanding of their broader implications.",
  "closureStep": "My current working hypothesis is that certain assumptions I've been operating under may not be entirely accurate, potentially due to cognitive biases or insufficient information. The next step is to actively seek out diverse perspectives and feedback from others to challenge these assumptions. Additionally, I will review recent decision-making patterns for any recurring assumptions and consider conducting a thorough analysis to identify and address any that are unsupported or limiting.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions right now to enhance decision-making and problem-solving effectiveness. This pattern of questioning my assumptions stems from a desire to ensure that my actions and conclusions are grounded in reality rather than misconceptions. By consistently challenging my assumptions, I'm fostering a habit of critical thinking and adaptability, which could lead to more innovative and informed outcomes."
