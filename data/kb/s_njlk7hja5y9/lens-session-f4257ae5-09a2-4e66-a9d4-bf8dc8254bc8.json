  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that will engage the target audience and differentiate from competitors. This involves understanding current trends, audience interests, and the unique value proposition of the product or service being marketed. The goal is to craft a narrative that resonates emotionally and motivates action, whether that's curiosity, excitement, or trust.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on crafting a story hook based on current trends and audience interests, we reframe the approach to leverage the timeless human experiences or emotions that transcend trends? Consider emphasizing universal themes like overcoming adversity, the joy of discovery, or the value of connection. This shift could lead to creating content that not only captures immediate attention but also builds lasting emotional connections with the audience.",

  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this topic further raises questions about how different cultural contexts influence the universal themes people resonate with, and how these themes can be adapted for niche markets. Additionally, it prompts an investigation into the role of technology and data analytics in identifying and predicting shifts in these timeless narratives. Lastly, it suggests examining how emerging mediums, like virtual reality or AI-generated content, can be harnessed to enhance storytelling and create more immersive and personalized experiences.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a story hook emphasizing a universal theme, such as overcoming adversity, will resonate broadly with audiences today. The next step is to tailor this theme to fit the specific cultural context and interests of my target audience, possibly using data analytics to refine the approach. I will also explore integrating emerging technologies, like AI or VR, to create a more engaging and immersive storytelling experience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this question right now because the need for effective marketing content is constant, and finding the right story hook is crucial for engagement and differentiation. The pattern in my approach seems to focus on immediate trends and audience interests, which might limit the potential for deeper, more meaningful connections. By stepping back and considering timeless human experiences and emotions, I can transcend the immediate and create content that remains relevant and impactful over time."
