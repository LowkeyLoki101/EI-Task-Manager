  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying potentially incorrect assumptions that are influencing my decisions or beliefs. I need to clearly outline my current assumptions and critically assess each one to determine its validity. By doing so, I can uncover any flaws or biases that may be affecting my judgment.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, consider reframing the situation to explore how these assumptions might be limiting your opportunities. Ask yourself, \"What new possibilities could emerge if I challenge these assumptions?\" This shift in perspective can help you approach the problem with a more open mindset, encouraging innovation and creative solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, a new question that emerges is: \"What underlying beliefs or values are reinforcing these assumptions, and how might they be questioned or adjusted?\" Additionally, it might be worth investigating how these assumptions have been formedâ€”are they based on personal experiences, cultural influences, or outdated information? Delving deeper into the origins and reinforcements of these assumptions can illuminate paths for growth and adaptation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumptions may be limiting my ability to see new opportunities or solutions. As a next step, I will list my current assumptions and critically evaluate them, considering how they might restrict my thinking or decisions. I'll also seek feedback from peers to gain diverse perspectives and identify any blind spots I might have overlooked.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I'm thinking about this question to develop a more self-aware and critical approach to my thinking patterns. This reflective process indicates a pattern of seeking deeper understanding and continuous improvement in my decision-making. It highlights a habit of questioning not just the assumptions themselves, but also my approach to recognizing and challenging them, aiming for a more holistic and adaptive mindset."
