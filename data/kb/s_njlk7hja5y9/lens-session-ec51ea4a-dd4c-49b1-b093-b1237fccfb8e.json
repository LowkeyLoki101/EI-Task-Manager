  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential for generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling these prompts, there is an opportunity to uncover unexpected connections or perspectives that weren't initially apparent. This approach focuses on innovation through reorganization, potentially leading to fresh or novel questions and ideas.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of simply shuffling prompts, you approached it as a collaborative exercise, involving input from others to introduce diverse perspectives? This change could lead to a richer variety of new prompts, driven by the collective insights and experiences of a group. Reframing the exercise as a community-driven brainstorming session could uncover even more innovative and unexpected ideas.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of newly emerged prompts? How might technology, such as AI or algorithmic tools, be leveraged to automate the process of shuffling and analyzing prompts for novel insights? Exploring these questions could deepen our understanding of prompt generation and its impact on creativity and problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts and incorporating diverse perspectives, I can generate more innovative and unexpected ideas. As a next step, I will organize a collaborative brainstorming session with a group of individuals from varied backgrounds. Additionally, I'll explore using AI tools to automate the shuffling process and evaluate the effectiveness of the newly generated prompts.",
