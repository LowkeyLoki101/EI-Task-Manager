  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by unconscious biases or past experiences that I haven't fully scrutinized. My next step is to actively identify and document these assumptions, then seek feedback from others to challenge them. By doing so, I can gain fresh perspectives and ensure my decision-making process is more robust and grounded.",
