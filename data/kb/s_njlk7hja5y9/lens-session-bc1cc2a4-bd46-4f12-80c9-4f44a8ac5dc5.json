  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of my underlying assumptions, which could be leading to faulty decisions or perspectives. The key is to identify which assumptions are influencing my current thinking and evaluate whether they are based on outdated information or biases. This involves scrutinizing my beliefs and considering alternative viewpoints to ensure they are grounded in reality.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially wrong assumptions, consider the possibility that some assumptions may actually be beneficial or necessary for decision-making. What if, rather than questioning every assumption, you focused on identifying which assumptions have led to successful outcomes in the past and why? This angle allows you to build on past successes while still being open to adjusting or discarding those assumptions that may no longer serve you well.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By questioning my assumptions, a new area of exploration emerges: What processes or tools can I implement to continuously evaluate and update my assumptions as new information becomes available? Additionally, it prompts an investigation into how my assumptions are shaped by cultural or cognitive biases, and what strategies can be employed to mitigate their influence. Exploring these questions could lead to developing a more adaptable mindset that remains open to change and new perspectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions might be influenced by outdated information or biases that need reevaluation. The next actionable step is to implement a regular review process, perhaps monthly, where I consciously reflect on my key assumptions and assess them in light of new data and perspectives. This will help ensure that my decision-making remains relevant and informed.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because my current decision-making may be influenced by unexamined assumptions, leading to potential errors. The pattern I might be repeating is consistently questioning assumptions without recognizing which ones are actually serving me well or need adjustment. By using a meta-lens, I can better balance my skepticism with an appreciation for assumptions that have historically contributed to success, allowing for a more nuanced approach to decision-making."
