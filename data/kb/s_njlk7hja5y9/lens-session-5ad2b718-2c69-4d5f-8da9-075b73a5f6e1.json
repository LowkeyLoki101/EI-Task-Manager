  "frameStep": "In my industry, there are emerging trends and technological advancements that could significantly impact how businesses operate and compete. There might be shifts in consumer preferences, regulatory changes, or new market entrants disrupting established models. It's crucial to identify these changes early to adapt strategies and maintain a competitive edge.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on the immediate changes and trends, I considered the underlying forces driving these shifts in my industry? By understanding the root causes, such as societal shifts, technological innovation cycles, or global economic influences, I could better anticipate future developments and position my business not just to react, but to shape the industry landscape proactively. This perspective might reveal opportunities to influence the market or create new value propositions that hadn't been visible from a surface-level analysis.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider how emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, or IoT could not only impact your industry but also transform related industries, creating new interdependencies or competitive landscapes. Additionally, investigate how global policy changes, such as environmental regulations or trade agreements, might indirectly affect your industry by altering supply chains or consumer behaviors. These insights could guide more robust strategic planning and innovation efforts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that understanding the underlying forces driving industry changes—such as societal trends, technological advancements, and global economic shifts—will provide deeper insights into future developments. The next actionable step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of these forces and their potential impacts on both my industry and interconnected sectors. This will involve researching emerging technologies, monitoring regulatory developments, and engaging with industry thought leaders to anticipate and shape future opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because staying informed about industry changes is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and agility in a rapidly evolving market. The pattern I notice is a reactive approach—responding to immediate trends rather than proactively understanding and influencing the underlying drivers of change. By shifting my focus to these foundational elements, I can develop strategies that not only react to changes but potentially shape future industry directions."
