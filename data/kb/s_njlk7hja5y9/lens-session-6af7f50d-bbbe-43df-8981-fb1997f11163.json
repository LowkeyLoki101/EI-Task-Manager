  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying a unique and surprising pattern in solar technology that hasn't been widely recognized. This involves uncovering an underexplored trend or breakthrough that could serve as a compelling narrative hook. The goal is to bring attention to an innovative aspect of solar technology that could captivate an audience and potentially influence future developments or perceptions in the field.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the technology itself, we looked at the socioeconomic or environmental impacts of solar technology that are being overlooked? By reframing the story to highlight how solar advancements are uniquely transforming communities or ecosystems in unexpected ways, we can develop a narrative that emphasizes the broader implications and benefits of solar technology beyond the technical aspects. This perspective could uncover human interest stories or ecological shifts that captivate audiences and inspire further innovation and adoption.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new technologies or innovations are currently emerging in solar energy that are not being widely discussed, and how could these potentially reshape industries or communities? Are there specific geographic regions where solar technology is having unexpected impacts, such as creating new economic opportunities or altering traditional energy dynamics? Further research could delve into the cultural shifts driven by solar adoption, examining how these changes influence local economies, social structures, and environmental policies.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the exploration of socioeconomic and environmental impacts, my working hypothesis is to develop a story that highlights the unexpected economic revitalization of remote or underserved communities through solar technology adoption. The next step is to research specific case studies of regions where solar energy has led to significant economic or social transformations, gathering data and personal stories to substantiate this narrative. This will provide a compelling and human-centered angle to the broader discussion on solar technology.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I aim to discover a novel angle in solar technology that isn't widely recognized, potentially offering a fresh narrative or insight. This reflects a recurring pattern in my approach: seeking out hidden or underexplored aspects within a field to uncover unique stories. By consistently focusing on these less obvious elements, I can offer new perspectives that challenge conventional narratives and drive deeper engagement."
