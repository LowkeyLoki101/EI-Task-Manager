  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by identifying specific data gaps and questions, we can tailor an existing simulation model to address these needs. The next step is to conduct a review of current simulation models and data sources to determine which can be adapted or combined to fill our data gaps. Additionally, considering collaboration with other experts in the field could provide access to different models or datasets that complement our objectives.",
