  "frameStep": "In your industry, it's crucial to pay attention to emerging trends and technologies that could disrupt traditional models, such as AI integration and sustainability practices. Additionally, monitor shifts in consumer behavior and regulatory changes that could impact operations and strategy. By staying informed about these factors, you can adapt more effectively and maintain a competitive edge.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing only on the broad trends like AI and sustainability, consider how these shifts specifically impact your role or niche within the industry. Reframe your attention to smaller, more immediate changes, such as how local competitors are adapting to these trends or how customer expectations are evolving in your specific market segment. This approach allows you to identify actionable opportunities or threats that might be more directly relevant to your day-to-day operations.",

The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on broad, industry-wide trends without considering how they specifically affect my niche or role, potentially overlooking immediate, actionable insights. By stepping back, I can recognize the need to balance big-picture awareness with a focus on localized, specific impacts that directly influence my work and strategy."
