  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is that there is a recurring pattern or trend that I am noticing, but it seems to go unnoticed by others around me. This could be due to a difference in perspective, experience, or focus, which allows me to identify something that others overlook. Clarifying this pattern and understanding why it stands out to me could help in communicating its significance to others.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the pattern as something others are missing, reframe it as an opportunity for collaboration. Consider that others might see different aspects or have complementary insights that, when combined with your observations, could lead to a more comprehensive understanding. This shift from a solitary perspective to a collaborative one could uncover deeper insights and foster a more inclusive analysis.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying cognitive biases or assumptions might be causing others to miss this pattern, and how can they be addressed? Additionally, what specific steps can I take to test my observations against diverse perspectives, and how might this process reveal new dimensions or nuances to the pattern? Exploring these questions could lead to a richer understanding and more effective communication of the pattern's significance.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I notice may be influenced by specific cognitive biases that others may not share, leading to its oversight. My next step is to engage in a dialogue with a diverse group of colleagues to present my observations and invite their perspectives. This collaborative approach will help test the validity of my hypothesis and potentially reveal additional insights or confirm the pattern's broader significance.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern right now because it represents a unique insight that I believe could add value to the collective understanding of the situation. By frequently noticing this pattern, I might be repeating a tendency to focus on identifying gaps in others' perceptions, which could lead to a sense of isolation or frustration. Recognizing this pattern in my approach, I can consciously shift towards engaging others and leveraging diverse perspectives to enrich the overall analysis."
