  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of my current assumptions. The issue lies in potentially relying on assumptions that may not be accurate or relevant, which could lead to flawed conclusions or decisions. The task is to identify these assumptions clearly and evaluate their accuracy to ensure a solid foundation for further thought or action.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different angle, consider that instead of focusing solely on assumptions that might be wrong, you could explore assumptions that might be incomplete or underdeveloped. This shift in perspective encourages a broader exploration, highlighting areas where additional information or perspectives could enhance understanding and lead to more robust conclusions. By doing so, you not only identify potential flaws but also create opportunities for deeper insights and innovation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens on this trigger raises questions about the origins and implications of the assumptions themselves. What underlying beliefs or biases might have led to these assumptions? Additionally, how do these assumptions interact with each other, potentially creating a network of flawed reasoning? Investigating these areas further could uncover deeper, systemic patterns in thinking that merit further research and reflection.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the exploration of assumptions, my working hypothesis is that my assumptions may be both incomplete and potentially biased. The next step is to systematically list these assumptions, critically evaluate their origins and validity, and seek additional perspectives or data to fill in any gaps. This approach will help ensure a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the situation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this issue now to ensure that my assumptions are not leading me astray, as faulty assumptions can significantly impact the quality of my decisions and outcomes. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing predominantly on identifying errors or gaps in my assumptions, rather than also considering how to broaden or enrich them with new information or perspectives. This reflection encourages me to shift from a purely corrective mindset to one that also seeks growth and expansion in understanding."
