  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "You are looking to design a simulation that generates new data applicable to your needs. The focus is on identifying a scenario or model that can be simulated to produce insights or information that are currently unavailable. Clearly defining the purpose and scope of the simulation will be critical to ensure that the data generated aligns with your objectives.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through a simulation, consider reframing the problem by asking, \"What existing data gaps can I identify that a simulation might help bridge?\" This shifts the perspective to a more targeted approach, where you first analyze the current data landscape and then use simulation to strategically fill those specific gaps. This approach ensures that the simulation is not only generating new data but is also directly addressing unmet needs and enhancing existing datasets.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, consider what specific outcomes or decisions the new data should inform and how they relate to existing decision-making processes. What are the potential variables or parameters that might be overlooked in current models, and how could simulating different scenarios with these factors provide new insights? Additionally, explore what advancements in simulation technology or methodologies could be leveraged to improve the accuracy or relevance of the data generated.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying specific gaps in our current data, I can design a simulation that strategically fills those gaps to support our decision-making processes. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of existing datasets to pinpoint these gaps and define the specific variables and scenarios that the simulation should address. This will ensure that the data generated is both relevant and actionable.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this question right now because there is a need to enhance our data-driven decision-making capabilities by generating new, relevant insights that are currently lacking. This reflects a pattern of seeking innovative solutions to fill knowledge gaps, often by leveraging simulations as a tool for exploration and discovery. By recognizing this pattern, I can ensure I'm approaching the problem with a clear understanding of the strategic gaps in our data landscape, thus allowing the simulation to be purposefully designed to address those specific needs."
