  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a question that has been overlooked or neglected in my self-reflection practices. I see an opportunity to uncover insights or areas of personal growth that may have been ignored or forgotten. The goal is to pinpoint a specific, meaningful question that can prompt deeper self-awareness or initiate positive change.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked myself, I considered the perspective of what questions others might ask me about my life or decisions? This shift could reveal blind spots or areas of growth that I might not have considered on my own. By imagining the inquiries from a mentor, friend, or even a future version of myself, I might uncover valuable insights and different dimensions of self-reflection.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this further, one might ask, \"What areas of my life have I unconsciously avoided questioning, and why?\" This can lead to deeper investigation into potential fears or discomforts that prevent self-inquiry. Additionally, considering \"What aspects of my identity or beliefs have I taken for granted without questioning their current relevance or truth?\" could prompt a reevaluation of core values and assumptions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are areas of my life and beliefs that I may be unconsciously avoiding due to discomfort or fear, and these areas hold potential for significant personal growth. As a next step, I will set aside time to journal or meditate on questions such as, \"What am I afraid to question in my life and why?\" and \"What long-held beliefs might no longer serve me?\" This will help bring these overlooked areas to the forefront for reflection and action.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it highlights my ongoing pursuit of self-awareness and personal growth. The pattern I might be repeating is relying heavily on self-directed questions, potentially overlooking the value of external perspectives. By considering how others might question my life or decisions, I can break this pattern and gain a more holistic understanding of areas I might be neglecting."
