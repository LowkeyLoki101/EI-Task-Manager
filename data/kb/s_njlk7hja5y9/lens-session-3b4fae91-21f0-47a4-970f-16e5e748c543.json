  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely an issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable, such as a challenging decision, a conflict with someone, or a situation where I fear failure or negative consequences. It could also be a task or responsibility that I find daunting or lack confidence in addressing. By framing the problem, I can identify it clearly and determine why it's causing avoidance, which is the first step in tackling it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of viewing this as a problem to confront, you reframe it as an opportunity for personal growth and learning? By approaching it as a chance to develop new skills or strengthen relationships, the situation becomes less about avoidance and more about embracing change and potential. This shift in perspective can reduce the fear of failure or discomfort and motivate proactive engagement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively exploring the problem of avoidance, new questions arise, such as: What are the underlying fears or beliefs that make this issue feel overwhelming? How have past experiences shaped my current approach to similar problems? Additionally, it may be valuable to investigate what strategies or support systems could help in addressing this avoidance. Deeper research could involve exploring psychological techniques for overcoming procrastination or avoidance behaviors, such as cognitive-behavioral strategies or mindfulness practices.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is tied to a fear of failure or discomfort, which can be addressed by reframing it as an opportunity for growth. My next step is to identify specific tasks or conversations I'm avoiding, write down the fears associated with them, and develop a small, actionable plan to address each one, starting with the least intimidating. This approach will help break down the overarching issue into manageable parts, making it easier to tackle systematically.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I realize that my tendency to avoid certain problems might be part of a broader pattern of procrastination or fear-driven avoidance. This reflects a habitual approach where discomfort or fear of inadequacy leads me to sidestep challenges instead of confronting them. Recognizing this pattern allows me to address the underlying habits and emotions driving avoidance, enabling me to adopt healthier, more constructive coping mechanisms."
