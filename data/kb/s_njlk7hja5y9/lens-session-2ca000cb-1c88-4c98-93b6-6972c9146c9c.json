  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience today. This involves understanding current trends, audience interests, and brand messaging to create a narrative that captures attention and drives engagement. The goal is to craft a story hook that is timely, relevant, and aligned with the brand's objectives.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of seeking a new story hook, you focused on revisiting and refreshing an old successful campaign that resonated well with your audience? By analyzing past content that performed well, you could adapt its core elements to fit current trends or integrate new insights, creating a bridge between proven strategies and contemporary relevance. This reframing emphasizes the iterative nature of content creation and leverages historical data for current success.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, explore what specific elements made past successful campaigns resonate with your audience. What emotional triggers or cultural references did they tap into? Additionally, investigate current societal shifts or emerging trends that could be integrated into these elements, such as sustainability or digital innovation. Delve into questions like: How can these past successful elements be adapted to align with today's digital platforms and audience behaviors? What new narrative techniques or technologies, like interactive content or augmented reality, could enhance the storytelling experience?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a marketing content strategy that leverages elements from past successful campaigns, adapting them to align with current trends like sustainability or digital innovation. The next actionable step is to conduct a detailed analysis of previous campaigns to identify key emotional triggers and cultural references, and then brainstorm ways to integrate these with contemporary narrative techniques and technologies. This approach aims to create a story hook that is both familiar and fresh, ensuring it resonates with today's audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this because the challenge of crafting effective marketing content is a recurring task that requires constant adaptation to stay relevant. The pattern I am repeating is the tendency to seek new and innovative ideas rather than leveraging existing successful strategies. By stepping back, I can recognize the importance of integrating past successes with current insights, thus creating a more sustainable and effective approach to content creation."
