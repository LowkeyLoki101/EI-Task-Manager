  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying an unexpected industry trend and using a simulation to generate new data that can provide insights or solutions related to that trend. The key challenge is to effectively merge the simulation model with the trend's unique characteristics to produce relevant and actionable data that can guide decision-making or innovation within that industry.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the approach, consider the unexpected industry trend not as a challenge but as an opportunity to anticipate future scenarios. Instead of focusing solely on the simulation's technical aspects, view it as a creative tool to explore 'what-if' situations that the trend might lead to. This perspective shifts the goal from merely generating data to using the simulation to craft potential narratives and strategies that could position you advantageously as the trend evolves.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific types of simulations could be most effective when applied to emerging or unexpected industry trends, and how can these simulations be adapted to capture the nuances of these trends? Additionally, what methodologies exist for validating the accuracy and relevance of data generated from simulations in the context of rapidly evolving industry landscapes? Exploring these questions could lead to discovering innovative simulation techniques and validation processes that ensure the data remains actionable and strategically advantageous.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by selecting a specific, unexpected industry trend and pairing it with a tailored simulation model, I can effectively generate fresh data that anticipates future scenarios and informs strategic decision-making. The next step is to identify a trend that holds significant potential for disruption or innovation and then design or adapt a simulation that captures the nuances of this trend. This will involve both selecting appropriate simulation techniques and establishing validation methodologies to ensure the data's relevance and accuracy in guiding industry-specific strategies.",
