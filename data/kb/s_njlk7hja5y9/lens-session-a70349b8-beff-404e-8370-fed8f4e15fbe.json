  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see that there is a recurring pattern or trend that I consistently notice, which others might overlook. This could be an opportunity to capitalize on an insight that provides a competitive advantage or a unique perspective. The challenge is to clearly identify and articulate what this specific pattern is and why it might be going unnoticed by others.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the patterns others might be missing, consider what assumptions or biases could be influencing their perspectives that prevent them from seeing these patterns. From this angle, the task shifts from simply identifying overlooked patterns to understanding the underlying reasons why they are overlooked. This perspective can open up opportunities to communicate more effectively and tailor solutions that address these specific blind spots.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In applying the recursive lens, consider how the process of identifying these patterns can be continuously refined. What methodologies or tools could enhance your ability to detect and articulate these patterns more clearly? Additionally, investigate the broader implications of these patterns: how might they evolve over time, and what external factors could alter their significance? Understanding these dynamics could lead to deeper insights and more effective interventions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the patterns I notice are overlooked due to common cognitive biases or lack of data interpretation skills among others. The next step is to develop a structured approach to communicate these patterns effectively, possibly through visual aids or interactive workshops, to highlight their significance and educate others on recognizing similar patterns in the future. Additionally, I'll explore tools or methodologies that can enhance my pattern detection and articulation skills.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because recognizing overlooked patterns can provide valuable insights and innovative solutions. The pattern I seem to be repeating is focusing heavily on the patterns themselves rather than examining why they might be overlooked by others. By applying a meta-lens, I can gain deeper understanding into the cognitive biases or contextual factors that prevent others from recognizing these patterns, allowing me to develop more effective ways to communicate and leverage these insights."
