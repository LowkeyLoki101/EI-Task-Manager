  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is exploring the potential creativity and innovation that might arise from rearranging and combining existing prompts in new ways. By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to discover fresh perspectives, generate novel questions, and possibly uncover unexpected insights that were not apparent in their original order. This exercise is about maximizing the utility of existing resources to stimulate new thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on shuffling existing prompts, I approached this exercise as a collaborative process, inviting others to contribute their own prompts into the mix? This reframing shifts the perspective from an individual exercise to a communal exploration, potentially enriching the pool of ideas and fostering diverse insights that go beyond my initial framework. By incorporating external inputs, the exercise becomes an evolving dialogue, enhancing creativity through shared experiences and perspectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, new questions arise such as: How do different contexts and combinations influence the meaning and interpretation of prompts? What patterns or themes emerge from repeatedly shuffling and analyzing these prompts over time? This exercise might also lead to deeper investigations into cognitive processes involved in creativity and how external influences shape idea generation, warranting exploration of interdisciplinary studies on cognitive flexibility and innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling prompts and incorporating contributions from others, I can generate a more diverse array of ideas and insights. The next step is to create a collaborative platform or session where participants can add their own prompts, allowing for a dynamic exchange of ideas. This communal approach will help identify new patterns and themes, enhancing the creative process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because it reflects a pattern of seeking innovation through rearrangement and recombination of existing ideas, a method often used to break out of conventional thinking. This approach mirrors a broader tendency to rely on internal resources for creativity, rather than consistently engaging with external influences or community input, which could further diversify and enrich the outcome."
