  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a question that has been overlooked or neglected in my self-reflection. This involves recognizing areas of my life or thinking that have not been recently examined or questioned, potentially missing opportunities for growth or insight. The goal is to pinpoint a question that can lead to new perspectives or understandings about myself or my circumstances.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked myself, I consider the questions I frequently avoid or find uncomfortable? By examining these areas, I might uncover deeper insights about fears or resistances that are holding me back. This angle allows me to delve into the reasons behind my avoidance, potentially leading to significant personal growth and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, the exploration of unasked questions brings up further inquiries: What are the patterns or themes in the questions I do ask myself regularly, and how do they differ from the ones I avoid? Additionally, what impact might uncovering these neglected or uncomfortable questions have on my personal and professional growth? Investigating these aspects could lead to a deeper understanding of my internal biases and the underlying fears or assumptions that shape my self-reflection.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the questions I avoid or find uncomfortable are likely tied to underlying fears or assumptions that need addressing. As a next step, I will dedicate time to journaling about these avoided questions, exploring why they make me uncomfortable and how facing them could contribute to my growth. This will provide a structured approach to uncovering and addressing areas that may have been previously neglected in my self-reflection.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it reflects a desire to uncover blind spots in my self-reflection, aiming for personal growth. This pattern suggests a recurring theme of self-improvement and introspection, yet it also highlights a tendency to focus on familiar paths of inquiry rather than exploring more challenging or uncomfortable questions. By stepping back, I can recognize the balance between comfort and challenge in my introspective practices, guiding me towards more diverse and potentially transformative reflections."
