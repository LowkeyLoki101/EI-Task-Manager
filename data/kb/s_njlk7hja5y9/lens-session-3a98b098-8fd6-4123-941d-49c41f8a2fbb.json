  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an engaging story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience. The goal is to craft a narrative that not only captures attention but also aligns with the brand's message and values. This requires understanding the audience's interests, current trends, and the unique selling propositions of the product or service.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on crafting a narrative that fits the brand's existing message, consider using a story hook that addresses a current, pressing issue your audience faces. This angle allows you to position your product or service as a solution, making the content immediately relevant and valuable. Alternatively, you could reframe the story hook to spotlight the customer's journey or transformation, emphasizing personal stories from real users that illustrate the product's impact.",

  "recursiveStep": "From the exploration of story hooks, new questions emerge: What are the current pressing issues or trends that my target audience is deeply engaged with? How can I gather authentic customer stories that highlight the transformation experienced through my product or service? These inquiries warrant deeper research into audience analytics, social listening, and customer feedback mechanisms to ensure the story hook is both relevant and impactful.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the exploration, my working hypothesis is to develop a story hook that addresses a current pressing issue faced by my target audience, positioning the product as a solution. As the next step, I will conduct research into current trends and audience concerns using social listening tools and customer feedback. Additionally, I will gather real customer testimonials that showcase personal transformations to incorporate authentic narratives into the marketing content.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By considering the meta-lens, I'm examining why I'm preoccupied with finding a story hook for marketing content right now. This focus likely stems from a pattern of striving to create meaningful connections with the audience through storytelling, a common challenge in marketing. It's possible I'm repeating a pattern of overemphasizing the brand's narrative without enough consideration of the audience's immediate needs or the broader context, such as current events or cultural trends, that might make the story more compelling and relevant."
