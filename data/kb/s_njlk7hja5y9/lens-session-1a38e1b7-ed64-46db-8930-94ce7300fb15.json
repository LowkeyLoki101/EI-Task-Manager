  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is about exploring the potential of generating new ideas or insights by reorganizing existing prompts. This involves examining how reshuffling prompts could lead to fresh perspectives or innovative solutions that weren't initially apparent. The goal is to leverage the randomness and unpredictability of shuffled prompts to spark creativity and uncover new connections or questions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of aiming to generate new prompts, the focus shifted to understanding the underlying themes or patterns within the existing prompts? By reorganizing them, perhaps the goal could be to identify recurring motifs or gaps in thinking that need addressing. This shift in perspective emphasizes analysis over creation, transforming the exercise into a reflective review rather than a creative brainstorm.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, shuffling prompts could lead to questions about the cognitive processes involved in creativity and how randomness influences idea generation. This approach might also prompt an investigation into how different arrangements of prompts affect problem-solving strategies and outcomes. Additionally, it could inspire deeper research into the psychological effects of randomness on human thinking and decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling existing prompts will reveal underlying themes and gaps in my thinking, offering fresh insights. As a next step, I will physically or digitally shuffle a set of my prompts and examine the new arrangements for patterns or motifs that emerge. This exercise will help identify areas for further exploration or refinement in my thought processes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about shuffling prompts, I'm exploring a pattern of seeking novelty and creative disruption in problem-solving. This approach reflects a tendency to rely on randomness as a tool for breaking out of established thought patterns. It highlights an underlying belief that innovation often stems from unexpected connections, and by stepping back, I can recognize this as a repetitive strategy I employ to stimulate fresh ideas and challenge conventional thinking."
