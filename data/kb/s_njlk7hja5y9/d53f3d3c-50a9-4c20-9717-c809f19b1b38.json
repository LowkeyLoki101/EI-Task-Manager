  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by categorizing prompts thematically, I can identify new connections and gain insights that are structured rather than purely random. The next step is to group prompts into categories based on recurring themes or topics, then analyze these groups for patterns or novel ideas. This structured approach aims to highlight relationships and gaps that can guide future exploration and creative thinking.",
