  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore the problem from a different perspective by reversing the usual order of operations or assumptions. By looking at the desired outcome first and working backwards, I can identify the necessary steps and potential obstacles that might not be apparent when approaching the problem in a traditional, forward manner. This could reveal inefficiencies or alternative solutions that streamline the process.",
  "reframeStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, consider reframing the situation as a creative exercise in role reversal. Imagine the problem as a completed puzzle and work towards disassembling it step-by-step. This perspective may uncover underlying assumptions and hidden dependencies that, when revealed, could lead to innovative solutions or improvements in the overall process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What assumptions are we making when approaching the problem forwards, and how might reversing these reveal new insights? Additionally, what are the potential intermediate steps or checkpoints when working backwards that could serve as effective starting points for alternate solutions? These questions deserve deeper investigation to identify overlooked elements and to streamline or innovate the problem-solving process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify key dependencies and assumptions that are typically overlooked when planning forwards. As a next step, I will outline the desired end result and then work backwards to map out the critical steps needed to achieve it, noting any assumptions or potential obstacles. This approach will help to refine the process and potentially uncover more efficient or innovative solutions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because I'm seeking innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the problem's structure. This approach allows me to break free from my usual linear thinking pattern, often focused on moving forward step-by-step, and instead explore the interconnectedness of the problem's components. By doing so, I can identify hidden assumptions and dependencies that might otherwise remain unnoticed, ultimately leading to more creative and efficient solutions."
