  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying a surprising pattern in solar technology that hasn't been widely recognized or explored. I see the potential to uncover a story hook by focusing on an unexpected innovation or trend within solar technology, such as a novel material or application, that is quietly transforming the industry or societal impact. The key is to pinpoint a development that is overlooked yet holds significant potential for disruption or change.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on technological advancements, consider reframing the exploration to examine the cultural or economic impacts of solar technology in unexpected regions or communities. For instance, investigate how solar technology is being adapted in remote or underserved areas to foster local innovation or economic resilience. This angle shifts the story hook from just the technology itself to the transformative effects it creates in diverse, perhaps overlooked, societal contexts.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By delving deeper into the cultural and economic impacts of solar technology in unexpected regions, further questions arise: What are the long-term effects of solar adoption on local economies and cultural practices? How are local communities adapting solar technology to suit their unique needs and environments? Additionally, exploring the intersection of solar technology with other emerging technologies, like AI or blockchain, could uncover novel synergies and applications that are currently underexplored. These inquiries can guide a more comprehensive investigation, potentially revealing unique stories of transformation and innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in the intersection of solar technology with local cultural and economic transformations in unexpected regions. As a next step, I will research specific communities where solar technology has been adapted in innovative ways, focusing on the synergy between solar technology and local practices. This will involve gathering data on economic impacts, cultural adaptations, and any emerging technological integrations, such as AI or blockchain, to craft a compelling narrative.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking a fresh angle in storytelling that can captivate an audience by highlighting an aspect of solar technology that is underappreciated. This approach reflects a recurring pattern in my problem-solving: I often look for untapped narratives that bridge technological advancements with broader societal impacts. This pattern helps me create compelling stories that resonate on multiple levels, engaging both technically minded individuals and those interested in societal change."
