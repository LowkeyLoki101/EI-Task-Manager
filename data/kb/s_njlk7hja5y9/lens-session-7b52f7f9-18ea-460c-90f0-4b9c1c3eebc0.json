  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying potentially incorrect assumptions that may be influencing my thinking or decision-making. I need to clearly recognize what these assumptions are and evaluate their validity. By pinpointing these assumptions, I can address any that are unfounded and adjust my approach accordingly.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying incorrect assumptions, consider reframing the situation by asking, \"What if my assumptions are actually correct, but my interpretation or application of them is flawed?\" This shift in perspective can help you explore whether the issue lies not in the assumptions themselves, but in how they are being utilized or integrated into your decision-making process. By examining the context and execution, you might discover areas for improvement or adjustment that were previously overlooked.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively, one might ask: \"What underlying beliefs or biases are influencing the assumptions I make?\" This prompts a deeper investigation into the cognitive frameworks or past experiences that shape one's current assumptions. Additionally, it could be valuable to explore whether similar assumptions have led to errors in the past, and if so, why they were overlooked or persisted, encouraging a broader examination of patterns in reasoning and decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by unconscious biases or past experiences that I haven't fully scrutinized. My next step is to actively identify and document these assumptions, then seek feedback from others to challenge them. By doing so, I can gain fresh perspectives and ensure my decision-making process is more robust and grounded.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because questioning my assumptions is crucial to ensuring sound decision-making and avoiding potential pitfalls. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too heavily on identifying incorrect assumptions rather than considering whether my interpretation or application of these assumptions is what needs adjustment. This reflective approach helps me break the cycle of doubt and leads to more effective problem-solving by balancing between questioning assumptions and enhancing their integration into my decisions."
