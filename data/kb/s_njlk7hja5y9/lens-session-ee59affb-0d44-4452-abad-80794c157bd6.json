  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about the problem of procrastination and its impact on my productivity and overall progress in personal and professional areas. By not addressing this issue, I am potentially missing out on opportunities for growth and improvement. It is crucial to identify what specifically causes this avoidance and how it affects my daily routine.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing procrastination solely as a problem to be solved, consider it as a signal highlighting areas where your current approach might not align with your motivations or interests. What if procrastination is not just avoidance but an indication that certain tasks need re-evaluation or re-prioritization to better match your goals and values? This perspective might open up new ways to address procrastination by aligning your tasks with what truly matters to you.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions arise such as: What specific tasks or types of work do I consistently procrastinate on, and why might these be misaligned with my interests or values? Additionally, what underlying beliefs or fears contribute to this avoidance, and how can I address them to improve my engagement with these tasks? Exploring these questions can lead to a deeper understanding of procrastination's root causes and more effective strategies for aligning work with personal motivations.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that procrastination signals a misalignment between certain tasks and my interests or values. The next step is to systematically identify these tasks and evaluate why they may not resonate with me. I will take action by setting aside dedicated time this week to analyze my current to-do list, reassess each task's alignment with my goals, and adjust priorities or approaches to better match my motivations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By considering this trigger through a meta-lens, I'm exploring why the issue of procrastination is surfacing now and whether this is a recurring pattern in my problem-solving approach. This suggests that I might often defer addressing issues until they become pressing, which could indicate a habitual tendency to prioritize short-term comfort over long-term benefits. Recognizing this pattern can help me develop strategies to break it by regularly reflecting on and realigning my actions with my core values and objectives."
