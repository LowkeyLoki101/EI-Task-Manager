Key Findings or Insights**\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing customer service in the retail sector by enhancing efficiency, personalization, and customer satisfaction. Key insights from the research indicate that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are increasingly being adopted to handle routine inquiries, which frees up human staff to address more complex issues. AI systems can analyze customer data to provide personalized recommendations, improving the shopping experience and fostering brand loyalty.
