  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or realizations in a given context. I'm looking to pinpoint what specific outcomes or pieces of information would genuinely catch me off guard. This involves examining current assumptions and beliefs to uncover what might defy those expectations.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on what would surprise you, you considered what assumptions you currently hold as certain or unchangeable? By identifying these perceived certainties, you can explore potential surprises by questioning their validity or imagining scenarios where these assumptions are proven false. This shift from seeking surprises to challenging foundational beliefs might reveal unexpected insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens to the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\", we can delve deeper into which specific assumptions or beliefs, when challenged, could lead to surprising discoveries. This could involve exploring questions like: What hidden biases influence my expectations? How might my current knowledge blind me to alternative perspectives? Additionally, investigating fields or topics outside my usual scope could unearth unexpected insights, prompting a reevaluation of what I consider surprising. These inquiries suggest a deeper investigation into cognitive biases, interdisciplinary approaches, and the limits of personal knowledge.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that exploring and challenging my current assumptions could reveal unexpected insights that genuinely surprise me. As a next step, I'll identify one or two core beliefs I hold as certain and actively seek information or perspectives that challenge these assumptions. This will involve engaging with diverse sources or experts in fields outside my usual scope to broaden my understanding and uncover potential surprises.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about what would surprise me to uncover hidden assumptions or overlooked possibilities, aiming to challenge my current understanding and broaden my perspective. The pattern I'm repeating is focusing on the unknown by questioning my certainties, which helps me maintain a mindset that is open to new insights and adaptive to change. This approach fosters continuous learning by deliberately seeking out areas where my existing beliefs might be incomplete or incorrect."
