  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is exploring the potential outcomes of rearranging existing prompts to generate new ideas or perspectives. By shuffling prompts, the aim is to discover fresh insights or creative directions that might not be apparent through the original sequence. This process seeks to enhance creativity and problem-solving by breaking conventional patterns of thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the prompts themselves, you considered the act of shuffling as a creative exercise in its own right? By viewing shuffling as an artistic method akin to improvisation or free association, you could unlock new ways of thinking and creativity without being confined to the content of the prompts themselves. This perspective emphasizes the process over the outcome, valuing spontaneity and the unexpected connections that arise.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the psychological and cognitive effects of engaging in prompt shuffling as a creative exercise? Could analyzing the patterns or themes that emerge from shuffled prompts offer insights into one's unconscious thought processes or creative inclinations? Furthermore, how might the practice of prompt shuffling influence collective creativity in group settings, potentially fostering collaborative innovation? These questions could lead to deeper research into cognitive creativity strategies and group dynamics in creative processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can reveal unconscious patterns and stimulate new creative pathways, both individually and collectively. The next step is to conduct a practical experiment by shuffling a set of my existing prompts and observing the new ideas or themes that emerge. I will document these outcomes and consider their implications for enhancing creativity and collaborative innovation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts right now because I'm seeking novel perspectives and creative breakthroughs, potentially driven by a desire to disrupt routine cognitive patterns. This approach mirrors a broader pattern in my thinking where I often explore methods that challenge conventional structures to foster innovation. Understanding this helps me appreciate the value I place on creativity and adaptability in problem-solving."
