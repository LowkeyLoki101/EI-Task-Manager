  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often arise from challenging underlying assumptions or exploring areas we've previously overlooked. As a next step, I will identify key assumptions in my current projects or beliefs and actively seek out information or perspectives that contradict or expand upon them. This approach aims to foster environments where surprise and innovation are more likely to occur.",
