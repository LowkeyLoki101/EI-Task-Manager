  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, I can uncover novel connections and ideas that may lead to innovative solutions or perspectives. The next step is to actively engage in this exercise by randomly rearranging existing prompts and documenting any emergent themes or insights. This will help me understand how randomness influences creativity and identify any recurring patterns that could inform future creative processes.",
