  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards could uncover hidden dependencies and assumptions that might not be evident when moving forward. As a next step, I will outline the desired outcome and systematically identify each preceding step required to achieve it. This reverse mapping will guide the identification of potential gaps or overlooked factors that need addressing.",
