  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an engaging and relevant story hook for creating marketing content that resonates with today's audience. I see the need to connect the content to current trends, emotions, or challenges that the target audience is experiencing. This involves crafting a narrative that not only captures attention but also aligns with the brand's message and values.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on current trends or challenges, consider reframing the story hook by tapping into timeless human experiences or universal truths that transcend the current moment. This approach could involve weaving narratives around fundamental human emotions like joy, fear, or curiosity that are always relevant, allowing the content to resonate more deeply and maintain its impact over time. This shift changes the focus from being trend-driven to creating content that has lasting emotional appeal and authenticity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, we should explore how different timeless human experiences can be effectively integrated into marketing content across various platforms and formats. Additionally, investigate how brands can balance between tapping into universal truths and staying relevant to current cultural contexts. Further research could delve into case studies of successful marketing campaigns that have effectively used universal themes, and examine how they maintained relevance over time.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that creating a story hook centered around a universal theme, such as resilience or the pursuit of happiness, can effectively engage audiences across various platforms. The next step is to select a specific theme and craft a narrative that aligns with our brand's core values, while also researching successful campaigns that have utilized similar themes. This will guide the development of authentic and emotionally resonant marketing content.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because crafting a compelling story hook is crucial for engaging the audience and ensuring the marketing content cuts through the noise. The pattern I'm repeating is focusing on immediate relevancy and trends, which can be limiting. By stepping back, I can recognize the importance of integrating universal themes that provide a balance between being timely and timeless, thus enhancing the content's emotional depth and longevity."
