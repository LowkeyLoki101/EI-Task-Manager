  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where people overlook the interconnectedness between seemingly unrelated events or data points, leading to missed opportunities for innovative solutions or insights. This often happens because individuals focus too narrowly on isolated issues rather than considering the broader, systemic context. Addressing this requires a shift towards holistic thinking and recognizing the potential for hidden relationships between elements.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the interconnectedness of events and data, I considered the role of cognitive biases that prevent people from seeing these connections? From this perspective, the pattern isn't just about missing links but about how mental shortcuts and preconceived notions hinder broader thinking. This shift suggests that addressing these biases through education and awareness could unlock new ways of seeing and solving problems.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens to the pattern of overlooked interconnectedness, new questions emerge about the underlying causes of cognitive biases that obscure these connections. This prompts an investigation into how specific biases like confirmation bias or anchoring affect our perception of interrelated data. Additionally, we should explore effective strategies for fostering holistic thinking, such as interdisciplinary education and collaborative problem-solving approaches, to mitigate these biases and enhance systemic awareness.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that cognitive biases are a significant barrier to recognizing interconnectedness in data and events. As a next step, I will focus on designing educational workshops or resources that highlight these biases and provide tools for fostering holistic thinking. This approach aims to enhance individuals' ability to perceive and leverage hidden connections for innovative solutions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern now because it highlights a recurring challenge in both personal and professional environments that can lead to missed opportunities for innovation. The pattern I'm repeating in my approach is focusing on external factors, like interconnectedness and cognitive biases, rather than considering internal factors, such as my own assumptions or limitations in understanding, that might also contribute to these oversights. By acknowledging this, I can broaden my perspective and enhance my problem-solving strategies."
