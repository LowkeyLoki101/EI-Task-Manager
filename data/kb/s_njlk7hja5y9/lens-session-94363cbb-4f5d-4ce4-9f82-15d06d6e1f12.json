  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern that is noticeable to me but seems to be overlooked by others. This could involve recognizing trends, behaviors, or anomalies in a specific context that aren't being acknowledged or addressed by those around me. The goal is to clearly articulate what this pattern is and why it might be significant or beneficial for others to recognize it as well.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the pattern itself, consider why others might be missing it. Is it due to a lack of access to the same information, differing priorities, or perhaps a different way of processing and interpreting data? By understanding the reasons behind the oversight, you might identify opportunities to bridge the gap and communicate the significance of the pattern more effectively to others.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens, one might ask: What are the underlying causes that prevent others from seeing this pattern? Are there cognitive biases or systemic barriers at play? Additionally, what methodologies or frameworks could be developed or refined to help others recognize and understand this pattern? Investigating these questions could lead to deeper insights into improving communication and awareness around the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I am noticing may be overlooked by others due to cognitive biases or a lack of awareness and access to specific data. The next step is to design a presentation or report that effectively communicates this pattern, highlighting its significance and potential impact. I will also seek feedback from colleagues to refine my approach and ensure that it resonates with and is accessible to a broader audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern recognition right now because I am often in situations where I notice discrepancies or trends that others overlook, which suggests a recurring theme of seeking to understand and communicate insights more effectively. This might reflect a pattern of striving for clarity and comprehension in complex situations, emphasizing the importance of not just identifying patterns but also the ability to convey their significance to others."
