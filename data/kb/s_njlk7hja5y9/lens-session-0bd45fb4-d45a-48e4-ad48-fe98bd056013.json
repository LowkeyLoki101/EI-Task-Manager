  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could challenge existing assumptions or beliefs. It involves exploring areas where surprises are likely to occur, potentially revealing blind spots or opportunities for growth. By framing it this way, we focus on uncovering hidden truths or elements that defy our current understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from a different perspective, consider approaching this trigger by asking, \"What are the assumptions or beliefs I hold that, if proven wrong, would completely alter my understanding or approach?\" This angle shifts the focus from the external discovery to introspection, emphasizing the internal biases or preconceptions that could be challenged. By looking inward, it invites a more personal exploration of surprise, where the unexpected revelations come from questioning and revising one's own perspectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" raises questions such as: What underlying assumptions am I making about what is surprising? How do my experiences and cognitive biases shape what I consider to be unexpected? This calls for deeper investigation into the nature of surprise itself, exploring psychological and cognitive research on surprise and examining how cultural, social, or personal factors influence our perceptions of the unexpected.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from challenging deeply held assumptions or uncovering overlooked details. As a next step, I will actively list my current beliefs and assumptions about a specific topic and explore contrary evidence or perspectives. This will help identify areas where unexpected insights are likely, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and potential paradigm shifts.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about what would surprise me because it challenges my existing knowledge and beliefs, pushing me to explore beyond my comfort zone. This pattern of curiosity and introspection often leads to personal growth and innovation, as it forces me to confront and potentially revise my assumptions. By consistently questioning what surprises me, I am cultivating a mindset that is open to learning and adapting."
