  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding likely stems from specific fears or beliefs that I need to identify and confront. My next step is to set aside dedicated time for introspection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to explore these fears and beliefs more deeply.
