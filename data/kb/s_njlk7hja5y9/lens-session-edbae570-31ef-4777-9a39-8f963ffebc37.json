  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see that the problem involves identifying assumptions that could be incorrect. The key issue is recognizing which underlying beliefs or thoughts are influencing my actions or decisions without being explicitly acknowledged. This requires examining my current mindset and the premises I'm operating under to determine if they are valid or need reassessment.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying wrong assumptions, consider reframing the situation as an opportunity to explore new possibilities by questioning existing assumptions. This approach shifts the perspective from seeking flaws to being curious about how different assumptions might lead to innovative solutions or insights. By doing so, you open yourself to a broader range of potential outcomes and creative thinking.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, questioning the assumption of being wrong itself can lead to further inquiry. What criteria am I using to determine if an assumption is wrong, and are these criteria themselves based on assumptions that need examination? Another layer of exploration involves considering how challenging these assumptions might impact my decision-making processes and whether there are systemic or habitual thinking patterns influencing these assumptions that deserve deeper investigation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions about decision-making criteria and habitual thinking patterns may be limiting my ability to explore innovative solutions. As a next step, I will actively list my current assumptions and critically evaluate them to identify any that might be unfounded or overly restrictive. This will involve seeking feedback from others to gain different perspectives and challenge my thinking further.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, I'm recognizing that my current focus on identifying wrong assumptions is part of a broader pattern of self-evaluation and critical thinking. This moment is an opportunity to reflect on why I consistently question assumptions—perhaps due to a desire for accuracy or fear of making mistakes—and to assess whether this pattern is serving or hindering my growth. Understanding the underlying motivation can help me balance constructive skepticism with openness to new ideas and experiences."
