  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I notice a recurring pattern where individuals consistently overlook the underlying connections between seemingly unrelated events or data points. This often results in missed opportunities for innovation or problem-solving. By focusing on identifying these hidden links, we can gain a deeper understanding and potentially discover new solutions or strategies.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the possibility that these overlooked connections could be a result of cognitive biases or limited perspectives that individuals have based on their experiences or roles. By fostering a culture of diverse perspectives and encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, we might uncover these hidden links more effectively. This reframing suggests that the key to identifying these connections lies not just in individual awareness but in collective, varied viewpoints.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this pattern of overlooked connections, new questions emerge: How can we develop tools or frameworks to systematically identify these hidden links? What role do technology and data analytics play in uncovering these patterns? Further investigation might include researching cognitive science to understand biases that lead to these oversight and exploring case studies where interdisciplinary collaboration resulted in innovative breakthroughs, providing actionable insights into fostering environments that encourage diverse viewpoints.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by cultivating environments that prioritize diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary collaboration, we can better identify and leverage the hidden connections between seemingly unrelated events or data points. The next step is to design and implement a pilot program in a team or organization that emphasizes cross-disciplinary interactions and regularly scheduled sessions for sharing and reflecting on diverse insights. This approach will help test the hypothesis and potentially lead to innovative solutions and strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking to understand why certain patterns are consistently overlooked by others, aiming to leverage these insights for better innovation and problem-solving. This pattern of inquiry may reflect a habitual focus on enhancing collective awareness and collaboration, suggesting a broader interest in promoting interdisciplinary approaches and diverse perspectives to uncover hidden connections. By recognizing this meta-pattern, I can consciously foster environments where such insights are more likely to emerge."
