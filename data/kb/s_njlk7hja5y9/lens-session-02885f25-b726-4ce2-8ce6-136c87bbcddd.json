  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern that I notice but seems to elude others. This could be an opportunity to leverage a unique insight or perspective that might benefit from further exploration and potentially lead to innovative solutions or improvements in a specific context. It's important to articulate and validate this pattern to determine its significance and applicability.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on identifying a pattern that might be elusive to others, consider what assumptions or biases might be clouding others' perspectives, preventing them from recognizing the same pattern you see. From this angle, the task shifts to understanding the underlying reasons for this oversight and exploring how to bridge that gap. This could involve facilitating discussions, sharing your observations in a way that resonates with others, and encouraging diverse viewpoints to bring the pattern into clearer focus for everyone involved.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific contexts or environments consistently reveal this pattern to you, and how can these settings be analyzed to uncover underlying mechanisms? Additionally, what methodologies or tools could you use to systematically investigate whether this pattern holds true across different contexts or if it's specific to certain conditions? These inquiries could lead to deeper research into cognitive biases, communication barriers, or systemic issues that might be obstructing broader recognition of the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I notice may be obscured for others due to cognitive biases or contextual blind spots. The next step is to conduct a small-scale study or workshop to gather diverse perspectives and test the visibility of this pattern among different groups. This could involve creating scenarios or simulations that highlight the pattern and analyzing participants' responses to identify common barriers to recognition.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I have a persistent sense that there is a recurring pattern I notice which others overlook, possibly due to different perspectives, experiences, or cognitive biases. This reflects a pattern in my own approach where I often seek to understand broader contexts or underlying structures that might not be immediately apparent to others. By stepping back, I can evaluate whether I'm inclined to assume others are missing patterns due to a lack of communication or shared understanding, and consider how I might better articulate my observations or foster collaborative environments to bridge this gap."
