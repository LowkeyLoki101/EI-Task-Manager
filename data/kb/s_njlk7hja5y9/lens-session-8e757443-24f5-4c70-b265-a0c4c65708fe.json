  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify aspects of my life or goals that I've neglected or assumed were settled. The problem is recognizing areas where I might be missing growth opportunities or failing to address changes. By asking myself overlooked questions, I can gain insights into areas needing attention or reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I considered not just the questions I haven't asked myself, but also the ones I've avoided or dismissed? By reframing my approach to consider these overlooked or ignored questions, I might uncover areas where I'm resistant to change or growth. This perspective shift could highlight fears or misconceptions that, once addressed, could lead to significant personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise such as: \"What specific areas of my life have I been avoiding evaluating because they feel uncomfortable or challenging?\" and \"How can confronting these neglected questions lead to actionable steps for growth?\" Additionally, it may be worth investigating the reasons behind this avoidance—whether they stem from fear, past failures, or misconceptions—and how addressing these root causes can lead to transformative changes. These questions deserve deeper research to uncover actionable insights and strategies for personal development.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by intentionally identifying and confronting questions I've avoided or overlooked, I can unlock areas for personal growth and address underlying fears or misconceptions. The next step is to set aside time for reflection, perhaps through journaling or discussion with a trusted friend, to explore these questions and develop a plan for addressing the areas they reveal. This will involve identifying specific life aspects I’ve neglected and creating actionable steps to foster growth and change.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm seeking deeper self-awareness and personal growth by uncovering neglected or avoided aspects of my life. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing primarily on familiar or comfortable areas while neglecting the challenging or uncomfortable questions. By stepping back with a meta-lens, I can recognize this tendency and intentionally challenge myself to explore these areas, fostering a more holistic approach to personal development."
