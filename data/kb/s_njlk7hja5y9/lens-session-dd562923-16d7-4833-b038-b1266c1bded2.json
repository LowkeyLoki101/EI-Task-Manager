  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an opportunity to reverse-engineer the typical process. By considering the desired outcome first and working backwards, I can identify any potential obstacles or steps that are often overlooked when approaching the problem in a conventional, forward manner. This backward approach could reveal new insights or solutions that are not immediately obvious when following the usual sequence of actions.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this problem from a creative perspective, consider treating it like a puzzle where you have all the pieces but need to understand the picture they create. Instead of starting with the pieces (individual steps) and trying to fit them together, start with the picture on the box (the final goal), and see how each piece contributes to that image. This could shift your focus from linear problem-solving to a more holistic understanding, allowing you to see connections and patterns that may not be obvious when following a traditional forward approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards prompts new questions such as: What assumptions are made when starting from the end, and how might these differ from forward assumptions? Are there intermediary goals or checkpoints that become more apparent when working from the outcome back to the start? Further investigation could involve exploring methodologies used in reverse engineering across different fields, such as software development or strategic planning, to identify patterns and strategies that can be adapted to this problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by reverse-engineering the problem, I can uncover hidden steps and assumptions that may not be apparent with a forward approach. The next step is to map out the desired outcome in detail and trace backwards to identify critical steps, potential obstacles, and intermediary goals. I will then compare this reverse path with the traditional approach to highlight new insights or strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about approaching the problem backwards is likely driven by a desire to innovate and break away from traditional patterns that might be limiting creativity or efficiency. This pattern of reversing the usual approach could be a recurring strategy you employ when faced with complex challenges, as it enables you to identify overlooked elements and gain fresh insights. By recognizing this pattern, you can consciously decide when it's most beneficial to apply this method, ensuring it's used effectively rather than out of habit."
