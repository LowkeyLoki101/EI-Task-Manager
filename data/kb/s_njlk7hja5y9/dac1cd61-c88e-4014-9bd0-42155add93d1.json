  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by analyzing existing datasets, we can identify specific gaps or questions that a simulation could address. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of current data to pinpoint these areas and then select or design a simulation model tailored to these needs. I will also explore technological advancements that could enhance simulation accuracy, ensuring the results are reflective of real-world scenarios.",
