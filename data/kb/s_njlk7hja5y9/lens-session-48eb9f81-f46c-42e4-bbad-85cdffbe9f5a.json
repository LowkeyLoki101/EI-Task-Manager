  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "I see a challenge in leveraging an emerging industry trend by developing a simulation model that generates new, relevant data. The goal is to create a dynamic simulation that mirrors real-world scenarios influenced by this trend, allowing for the exploration of its impacts and opportunities. This approach requires identifying key variables influenced by the trend and integrating them into a simulation framework that can produce actionable insights.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached the problem from the perspective of creating a collaborative platform where industry experts and data scientists work together to identify unexpected trends? By combining their expertise, we could develop simulations that not only generate new data but also validate and refine these trends in real-time. This collaborative approach might lead to more robust simulations that are closely aligned with actual industry shifts and provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential impacts and opportunities.",

  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential ethical considerations when creating simulations based on emerging industry trends, particularly in terms of data privacy and security? How can we ensure that the simulations remain adaptable to rapidly changing trends, and what mechanisms can be put in place to continuously integrate real-world feedback into the simulation models? Additionally, what are the best practices for fostering effective collaboration between industry experts and data scientists to ensure that the simulations remain relevant and insightful?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a collaborative platform that integrates the expertise of industry leaders and data scientists to create and refine simulations based on emerging trends. The next step is to outline a framework for this platform, specifying mechanisms for ethical data handling, adaptability to changing trends, and continuous real-world feedback integration. I will initiate discussions with potential stakeholders to gather insights on best practices for collaboration and simulation development.",
