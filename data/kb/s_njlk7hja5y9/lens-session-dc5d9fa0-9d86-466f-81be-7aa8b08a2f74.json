  "trigger": "How can I identify and simulate an unexpected trend in the solar energy sector to uncover new business opportunities that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying and simulating unexpected trends in the solar energy sector to discover business opportunities that are not yet apparent to others. This involves closely analyzing emerging technologies, market shifts, and policy changes that could influence the sector. The goal is to anticipate these trends before they become mainstream and leverage this foresight to create innovative business strategies.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of solely focusing on identifying and simulating trends based on current market data and technological advancements, consider exploring interdisciplinary approaches by integrating insights from fields like behavioral economics, sociology, and environmental psychology. By understanding how human behavior and societal shifts might drive adoption and innovation in solar energy, you can uncover hidden trends and opportunities that purely data-driven methods might overlook. This approach emphasizes the human and societal factors that could lead to unexpected developments in the sector.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider what specific interdisciplinary methods could be integrated into the solar energy analysis, such as studying the cultural shifts towards sustainability or changes in consumer behavior due to climate awareness. Additionally, investigate how emerging technologies in other sectors, like AI or blockchain, might intersect with solar energy to create novel business models. Delve deeper into the impact of global geopolitical changes on solar energy supply chains and policy adaptations, which could reveal unexpected trends and opportunities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that interdisciplinary insights, particularly those focused on human behavior and societal trends, can reveal unexpected opportunities in the solar energy sector. As a next step, I will conduct a detailed analysis incorporating behavioral economics and cultural studies to identify potential trends. Additionally, I will explore how emerging technologies like AI and blockchain could intersect with solar energy to inform innovative business strategies.",
