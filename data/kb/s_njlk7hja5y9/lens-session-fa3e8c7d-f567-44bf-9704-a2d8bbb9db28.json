  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to address. It could be related to personal responsibilities, professional challenges, or a difficult decision that I have been procrastinating on. By identifying this problem, I can begin to break it down into manageable steps and address it systematically.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something to avoid, consider it an opportunity for growth and personal development. What if addressing this problem could lead to significant positive changes in your life or open up new possibilities you haven't considered? By shifting the perspective from avoidance to opportunity, the problem becomes a catalyst for progress rather than a source of stress.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From exploring the problem I am avoiding, new questions arise: What specific fears or uncertainties are causing me to avoid this issue? Are there underlying patterns in my behavior that lead me to consistently avoid similar problems? Delving deeper, it might be valuable to investigate potential resources or support systems that could assist me in tackling this problem, as well as exploring past experiences that could provide insights into effective strategies for addressing similar challenges.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is tied to a fear of failure or the unknown, which has been a recurring theme in my past challenges. The next step is to clearly define the specific issue and break it down into smaller, actionable tasks. I will also seek support from trusted mentors or peers to gain different perspectives and encouragement, setting a timeline for addressing each task to ensure progress.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because recognizing and addressing avoidance patterns is crucial for personal and professional growth. This pattern of avoiding difficult problems is likely a recurring theme where I tend to delay confronting uncomfortable situations. By analyzing this habit through a meta-lens, I can better understand its roots and work towards developing healthier problem-solving strategies."
