  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can help streamline the problem-solving process by highlighting critical steps and potential obstacles early on. The next step is to apply this reverse approach to a specific problem I'm currently facing, documenting each step taken and the insights gained. This will allow me to evaluate its effectiveness and adjust my problem-solving methods accordingly in future situations.",
