  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can uncover hidden assumptions and biases while identifying alternative solutions that may not be evident through conventional methods. The next step is to conduct research into case studies and cognitive science literature on backward problem-solving to validate this approach. Additionally, I'll explore analogous situations that have been successfully addressed in different industries to gain further insights and strategies.",
