  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying an engaging story hook for today's marketing content. The goal is to capture the audience's attention with a narrative that resonates with current trends or emotional appeals. This requires understanding the target audience's interests and the context in which they'll encounter the content.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on crafting a story hook that aligns with current trends, consider creating a hook that taps into timeless, universal human emotions or experiences that transcend trends. Alternatively, approach the hook from the angle of addressing a common problem or pain point your audience faces, positioning your content as a source of valuable solutions or insights. This shift in perspective could lead to content that not only captures attention but also fosters deeper engagement and relatability.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens, we might ask: What are the underlying universal emotions or experiences that consistently resonate across different audiences? How can we investigate current audience data to uncover recurring pain points or desires that our content could address? Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore historical case studies of successful marketing campaigns to identify patterns or elements that could inform the creation of a compelling story hook today.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a compelling story hook should tap into a universal emotion or experience, such as resilience or transformation, while also addressing a specific pain point relevant to the target audience. My next step will be to analyze current audience data to pinpoint these pain points and cross-reference them with successful historical marketing examples that utilized similar emotional appeals. This approach will guide the creation of a story hook that is both engaging and relatable.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this question right now because I aim to create content that effectively captures and maintains my audience's attention, which is crucial for successful marketing. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too narrowly on current trends, rather than exploring deeper, more enduring themes or solving my audience's specific problems. By using a meta-lens, I can broaden my approach to include timeless emotional connections and practical solutions that resonate more profoundly with the audience."
