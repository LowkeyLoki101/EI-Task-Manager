  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I notice that I often see connections and patterns in data or situations that others overlook, particularly in how different elements influence each other over time. This might involve identifying underlying trends that are not immediately obvious or recognizing how small changes can lead to significant impacts. By clearly articulating and sharing these insights, I can help others see the bigger picture and make more informed decisions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this from the perspective of collaboration rather than individual insight? Instead of focusing solely on the patterns I notice, I could engage in dialogues with others to explore diverse perspectives and potentially uncover patterns that I might be missing myself. By fostering a culture of shared exploration, I could enhance collective understanding and decision-making, leveraging the power of multiple viewpoints to see beyond what any single individual might catch.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In applying the recursive lens, new questions arise: How might I systematically document and validate the patterns I notice to ensure they're not subjective biases? Could I develop a framework or set of tools that assist in pattern recognition, which could be shared and iteratively improved upon by others? These avenues deserve deeper investigation to refine how insights are captured and leveraged collaboratively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by systematically documenting and validating the patterns I notice, I can distinguish genuine insights from subjective biases. The next step is to develop a framework or set of tools for pattern recognition that can be shared with others. I will begin by outlining key criteria for identifying patterns and seek feedback from colleagues to iteratively refine this approach, fostering a culture of collaborative exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because I habitually focus on identifying unique patterns as a way to contribute value, often assuming that my insights are singular and not considering the potential for collective insight. This pattern reflects a tendency to prioritize individual analysis over collaborative exploration, which might limit the broader understanding and innovative solutions that can emerge from diverse perspectives. By recognizing this, I can consciously shift towards more inclusive and collaborative approaches in my pattern recognition efforts."
