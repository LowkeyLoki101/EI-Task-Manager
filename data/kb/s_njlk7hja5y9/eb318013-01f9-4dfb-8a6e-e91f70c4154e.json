  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that integrating prompts from diverse disciplines and systematically analyzing the recombination of prompts across thematic categories can lead to more innovative insights than simply shuffling my own prompts. The next step is to gather prompts from varied sources, categorize them, and use a tool or method to experiment with their combinations to identify novel connections and insights. This structured approach will help maximize the creative potential of the exercise.",
