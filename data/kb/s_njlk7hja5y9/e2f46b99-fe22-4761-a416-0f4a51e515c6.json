  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can illuminate critical steps and dependencies often overlooked in forward planning. As a next step, I will test this hypothesis by selecting a specific problem and outlining the desired outcome first, then mapping out the preceding steps needed to achieve it. Additionally, I will explore lateral thinking approaches in parallel to identify any innovative solutions that may arise, comparing the effectiveness of each method.",
