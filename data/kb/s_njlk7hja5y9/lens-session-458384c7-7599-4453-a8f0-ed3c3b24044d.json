  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a surprising and underexplored pattern in solar technology that can be transformed into a compelling story hook. I see a potential opportunity in examining the unexpected environmental impacts or socioeconomic shifts driven by rapid solar technology adoption in regions not traditionally associated with technological advancement. This could offer fresh insights and narratives that challenge conventional perceptions of solar technology's role in global change.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we reframed the exploration to focus on how solar technology is transforming unexpected industries rather than just regional impacts? For instance, consider how solar advancements are revolutionizing sectors like agriculture or urban planning in ways that are not immediately apparent. This shift in perspective could uncover untold stories of innovation and adaptation, illustrating solar technology's broader, often overlooked, influence on diverse facets of life.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the long-term ecological effects of integrating solar technology into unexpected industries like agriculture, and how might these changes influence future environmental policies? Additionally, could the socioeconomic impacts of solar technology in traditionally non-technological areas lead to new forms of economic structures or community-based energy models? These questions warrant deeper investigation to uncover hidden narratives and forecast potential outcomes of solar technology's expansion.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that solar technology is quietly transforming unexpected industries such as agriculture and urban planning, leading to surprising ecological and socioeconomic impacts. The next step is to conduct in-depth research on specific case studies where solar technology has been integrated into these sectors, identifying patterns of change and innovation. This research will form the basis for developing a unique narrative that highlights these hidden transformations and their broader implications for future environmental and economic policies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm seeking a fresh narrative within the growing field of solar technology, aiming to differentiate my work from the typical stories told. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too narrowly on technological advancements themselves, rather than their broader, intersecting impacts across various sectors and communities. By stepping back, I can identify more holistic and less conventional narratives that capture the nuanced ways solar technology interweaves with and transforms the world."
