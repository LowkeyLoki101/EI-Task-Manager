  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that all my current beliefs and decisions are based on correct and fully informed assumptions. This might lead to overlooking errors or biases in my thinking that could impact outcomes. It is important to identify and question these assumptions to ensure they are valid and based on accurate information.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of questioning whether my assumptions are wrong, I could reframe the situation by exploring what new perspectives or information I have not yet considered. This approach shifts the focus from potential errors to opportunities for learning and growth, encouraging an open-minded exploration of alternative viewpoints and novel ideas that could enrich my understanding and decision-making process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific assumptions underpin my current beliefs, and how can I systematically evaluate their validity through different perspectives? Are there cognitive biases influencing my assumptions that require further exploration? Additionally, what methods or tools can I adopt to continuously challenge and update my assumptions as new information becomes available? These questions deserve deeper investigation to ensure a robust and adaptive decision-making process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my foundational assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or outdated information. As a next step, I will identify and list these assumptions, then systematically evaluate them using research and diverse perspectives. I will also adopt tools like critical thinking frameworks and feedback from others to continuously challenge and update my assumptions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about questioning my assumptions right now because I am likely in a pattern of self-reflection aimed at improving my decision-making. This pattern often involves scrutinizing my thought processes to uncover biases or errors. By using a meta-lens, I recognize that this introspection might either lead to growth or result in over-analysis, suggesting a need to balance critical evaluation with actionable insights to avoid paralysis by analysis."
