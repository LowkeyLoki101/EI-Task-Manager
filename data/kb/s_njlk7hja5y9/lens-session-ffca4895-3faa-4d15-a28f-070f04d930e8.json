  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to generate novel ideas and perspectives that weren't initially apparent. This process challenges my habitual thinking patterns and encourages creative exploration by rearranging familiar concepts into new configurations. The goal is to discover fresh insights and questions that could lead to innovative solutions or approaches.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, shuffling your own prompts could be viewed as a way to disrupt cognitive biases and assumptions that typically guide your thinking. Instead of just seeking new ideas, this approach might also reveal underlying themes or patterns in your thought process that you weren't consciously aware of. By altering the sequence and context of your prompts, you might uncover blind spots or hidden connections that can lead to more profound self-awareness and growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific patterns or themes consistently emerge from my shuffled prompts, and how do they reflect my underlying cognitive biases or interests? Additionally, how might this method of shuffling prompts be structured to systematically uncover and address gaps in my knowledge or experience? Investigating these areas could lead to more tailored strategies for enhancing creativity and personal development.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, I can uncover recurring patterns and themes that highlight my cognitive biases and interests. As a next step, I will document the prompts generated from this exercise and analyze them for themes or patterns over time. This will help me identify any biases or gaps in my thinking, and develop targeted strategies to expand my knowledge and creativity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because I'm seeking to break free from entrenched patterns of thought and stimulate creativity through unexpected combinations. This reflects a broader pattern in my approach: a desire to innovate by challenging my cognitive routines and exploring the boundaries of my current understanding. By examining these patterns, I can gain insights into how I approach problem-solving and creative tasks, allowing for more intentional and diverse strategies in the future."
