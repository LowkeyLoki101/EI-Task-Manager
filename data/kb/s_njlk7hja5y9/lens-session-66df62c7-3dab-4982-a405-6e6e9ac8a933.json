  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a situation is accurate and without errors. This assumption might be incorrect if I have overlooked important information or if my perspective is biased. By questioning this assumption, I aim to identify potential blind spots or inaccuracies in my thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this assumption from the perspective of someone with a completely different background or set of experiences? By considering how someone with different expertise or cultural understanding might view the situation, I might uncover alternative interpretations or overlooked aspects that challenge my current belief. This could lead to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the situation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific biases or cognitive shortcuts might be influencing my assumption? How can I identify and mitigate these biases to ensure a more objective analysis? Additionally, what methodologies or tools can I use to gather perspectives from people with different backgrounds to challenge and refine my current understanding? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper investigation into cognitive biases and cross-cultural communication techniques.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current assumption may be influenced by unrecognized biases or a limited perspective. To address this, I will actively seek diverse viewpoints by consulting individuals from different backgrounds or expertise relevant to the situation. Additionally, I will review literature on cognitive biases to better identify and mitigate them in my analysis.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about challenging my assumptions right now because I aim to improve my understanding and decision-making by identifying potential biases or errors in my thought process. This reflects a pattern of seeking self-improvement and a deeper comprehension of complex issues. By doing this, I am likely trying to cultivate a habit of critical thinking and openness to diverse perspectives, which can lead to more effective problem-solving and innovation."
