  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is a significant issue or challenge in my life that I have not yet confronted, possibly due to fear, uncertainty, or discomfort. This avoidance might be hindering my personal growth or causing ongoing stress. Identifying and acknowledging this problem is the first step towards addressing it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't a negative aspect but rather an opportunity disguised as a challenge? Instead of viewing it as a hurdle to overcome, I could reframe it as a chance to learn, grow, and potentially transform an area of my life that could lead to unexpected benefits. By approaching it with curiosity rather than fear, I might discover new strengths and insights that were previously hidden.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific fears or beliefs are causing me to avoid thinking about this problem, and how can I explore these underlying issues further? Are there particular patterns or past experiences that might be influencing my current avoidance, and what steps can I take to address these root causes? By delving deeper, I might uncover actionable insights and strategies to not only confront the problem but also prevent similar avoidance in the future.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is actually an opportunity for growth and transformation. The next step is to identify and confront the specific fears or beliefs that are causing me to shy away from this issue. I will set aside time to reflect on past experiences that may be influencing my avoidance, and use this insight to develop a concrete action plan for addressing the problem head-on.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this problem avoidance right now because it might be a recurring pattern where I tend to sidestep difficult situations, possibly due to an underlying fear of failure or discomfort with uncertainty. By recognizing this pattern, I can become more aware of how often I default to avoidance and can begin actively challenging this habit, transforming it into a more proactive approach to problem-solving. This awareness can also guide me in developing strategies to face challenges head-on, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than threats."
