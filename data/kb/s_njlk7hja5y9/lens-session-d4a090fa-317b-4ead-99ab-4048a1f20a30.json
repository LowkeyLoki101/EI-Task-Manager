  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying something unexpected or unforeseen that, if discovered, would challenge current assumptions or beliefs. This involves examining areas of familiarity to uncover hidden anomalies or truths that defy expectations. The goal is to pinpoint what would truly be surprising in order to prepare for or address it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the idea of discovering something surprising, consider approaching it from the perspective of potential opportunities rather than anomalies. Instead of seeking out what might defy current beliefs, focus on what unexpected finding could lead to new innovations or breakthroughs. This shift in perspective turns the search for surprises into a proactive quest for hidden potential and untapped resources that could positively impact your field or personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, we could explore what foundational assumptions or frameworks are currently in place that might be challenged by finding something surprising. This could lead to questions such as: What are the core beliefs or theories in my field that are taken for granted? What are the implications if these are proven incorrect? Additionally, investigating historical precedents where surprising discoveries led to significant paradigm shifts could provide insight into potential areas ripe for unexpected developments.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that uncovering a fundamental flaw or overlooked opportunity within my current framework could lead to significant innovation or change. The next step is to conduct a thorough review of my core assumptions and methodologies, especially those considered infallible or settled, to identify potential areas for surprising discoveries. I will also look into historical cases of unexpected breakthroughs for patterns and insights that could inform my search for hidden opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now to challenge my current assumptions and beliefs by seeking out unexpected discoveries. This approach is a pattern in how I often engage with problems, looking for anomalies or surprises that could disrupt my understanding. By applying a meta-lens, I aim to shift this pattern towards embracing these surprises as opportunities for innovation and growth, rather than merely disruptions."
