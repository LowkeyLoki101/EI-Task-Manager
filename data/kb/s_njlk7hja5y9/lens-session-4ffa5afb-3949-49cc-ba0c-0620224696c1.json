  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential for generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to discover novel combinations or perspectives that may not have been previously considered, thereby enhancing creativity and innovation.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of shuffling prompts randomly, I categorized them by themes or goals before rearranging? This approach could provide more structured insights, allowing for deeper exploration of specific areas while still fostering creativity by highlighting unexpected connections within a particular context. By reframing the process to focus on thematic categorization, I might uncover more targeted and relevant innovations.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific themes or categories should be considered when organizing the prompts before shuffling? How might the impact of thematic shuffling differ across various fields or disciplines, such as technology, art, or science? Additionally, what tools or methods could be employed to effectively categorize and shuffle prompts, ensuring that the process remains both dynamic and insightful? Exploring these questions could lead to a more systematic approach to generating innovative ideas.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that categorizing prompts by themes before shuffling can lead to more structured and insightful innovations. As a next step, I will identify key themes relevant to my field and organize my prompts accordingly. Then, I will experiment with different shuffling methods to observe which combinations yield the most novel and relevant ideas.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking ways to break out of habitual thinking patterns and stimulate innovation. This approach reflects a recurring pattern of using randomness or reorganization as a tool for creativity, indicating a reliance on external structure to catalyze fresh insights. By examining this pattern, I can explore whether there are more deliberate techniques, like thematic categorization, that might offer similar benefits with potentially greater depth and focus."
