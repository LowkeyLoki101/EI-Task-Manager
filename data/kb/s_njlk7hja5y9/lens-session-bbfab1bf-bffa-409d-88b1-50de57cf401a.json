  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying and questioning an assumption that may be incorrect. The task is to pinpoint a specific belief or idea currently taken for granted, which could be impacting decisions or perspectives. This requires a clear identification of the assumption so that it can be evaluated and potentially revised.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying an assumption that might be wrong, consider reframing the approach to explore which assumptions are most vulnerable to change based on new information or perspectives. What if the goal is not just to find a potentially incorrect assumption, but to discover assumptions that have the greatest potential for growth and adaptation? By doing this, you shift from a mindset of correcting errors to one of continuous learning and improvement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What broader systems or contexts could be influencing the assumptions being made, and how might these change over time? Additionally, what are the underlying beliefs or values that support these assumptions, and how could they be reevaluated or challenged to cultivate more nuanced understanding? Exploring these questions can lead to deeper insights and potentially uncover additional assumptions that warrant examination.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I may be assuming the permanence of certain beliefs or systems without considering how they might evolve. The next step is to actively seek out diverse perspectives and new information that could challenge these assumptions. I will schedule time each week to engage with different viewpoints, whether through reading, discussions, or attending events, to ensure my assumptions remain adaptable and informed by continuous learning.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this trigger right now because questioning assumptions is crucial for growth and adaptability, especially in uncertain or changing environments. The pattern I'm repeating is a focus on error correction, which tends to emphasize fixing mistakes rather than fostering a broader mindset of learning. By stepping back, I can shift towards a more dynamic approach that values continuous adaptation and the exploration of new perspectives."
