  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a meaningful question that I have not considered recently, which could provide insight or prompt personal growth. This involves reflecting on various aspects of my life—personal, professional, emotional, or intellectual—that may have been neglected or are due for reassessment. By pinpointing such a question, I can uncover areas that require attention or change.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on identifying a question I haven't asked myself, I could reframe the approach by considering what assumptions I've been operating under without questioning. By examining these underlying assumptions, I might uncover areas of my life that are in need of reevaluation or adjustment, which could lead to meaningful insights and personal growth. This shift from seeking a question to challenging assumptions can open up new perspectives and opportunities for change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions emerge such as: \"What impact have my unexamined assumptions had on my decision-making?\" and \"Which areas of my life feel stagnant, and could this be linked to unchallenged beliefs?\" These questions warrant deeper investigation into specific life domains—such as career choices, personal relationships, or self-perception—where assumptions may have gone unchallenged, potentially uncovering opportunities for growth and transformation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging unexamined assumptions, I can uncover areas in my life that may need reevaluation. The next step is to set aside time for reflective journaling, focusing specifically on areas like career choices and personal relationships, to explore these assumptions. This will help me gain clarity and potentially initiate meaningful changes based on new insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "In considering why I'm prompted to think about a question I haven't asked myself in a while, it's possible that I'm seeking a deeper understanding or new perspective in my life, indicating a pattern of self-reflection and continuous growth. This approach to regularly challenge my thoughts may stem from a desire to avoid stagnation and ensure that I am not inadvertently neglecting important aspects of my personal or professional life. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously decide if this regular self-evaluation is serving me well or if it’s time to explore other methods for personal development."
