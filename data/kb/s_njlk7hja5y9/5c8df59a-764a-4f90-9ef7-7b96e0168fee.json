  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions might be influenced by outdated information or biases that need reevaluation. The next actionable step is to implement a regular review process, perhaps monthly, where I consciously reflect on my key assumptions and assess them in light of new data and perspectives.
