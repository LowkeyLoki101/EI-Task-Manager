  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation to generate new data that can be used for analysis or decision-making. This involves determining the specific parameters, variables, and goals of the simulation to ensure that the data created is relevant and useful for the intended purpose.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what simulation to run, consider what specific questions or problems you are trying to solve with the new data. By reframing the trigger to focus on the end goal, such as \"What decisions are we aiming to inform with this new data?\" you may find that the approach to creating the data shifts, potentially leading to alternative methods beyond traditional simulations, like leveraging existing datasets or engaging in scenario planning exercises. This perspective prioritizes the purpose of the data over the method of its creation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of the recursive lens, new questions arise such as: What specific variables and parameters need to be included in the simulation to ensure the data generated is accurate and relevant? Additionally, what existing simulations or models could be adapted or expanded to meet our data needs? Further research could explore the advancements in simulation technologies and methodologies that might offer innovative ways to generate the necessary data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by clearly defining the decision or problem we aim to address with the new data, we can better determine the most suitable simulation or alternative method to pursue. The next step is to conduct a needs assessment with stakeholders to clarify these goals, which will inform the selection or development of a simulation model or alternative data generation approach. This focused alignment ensures that the data produced is both relevant and actionable for decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because there is an underlying need to generate data for informed decision-making or analysis. The pattern I am repeating is focusing on the technical aspect of data creation, such as running simulations, rather than first clarifying the strategic questions or decisions that the data is meant to address. By stepping back, I can ensure that the approach to data generation is aligned with the broader objectives and not just a technical exercise."
