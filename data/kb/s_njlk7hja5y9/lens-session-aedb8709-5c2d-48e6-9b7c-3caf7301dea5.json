  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see an underlying assumption that my current understanding or belief may have flaws or inaccuracies. The problem is identifying which specific assumption might be incorrect and how it impacts my perspective or decision-making. By clearly recognizing this, I can begin to critically evaluate my beliefs and consider alternative viewpoints.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on identifying a potentially flawed assumption, reframe the situation by considering the broader context: What new information or perspective could I explore that might challenge my current beliefs, regardless of whether they're wrong or right? By shifting the focus from finding errors to expanding understanding, I open myself up to a learning opportunity that could enrich my perspective and decision-making process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, a series of new inquiries arise: What methods can I use to systematically identify and evaluate my assumptions? How do different contexts or perspectives influence the assumptions I hold? Furthermore, what role do cognitive biases play in shaping these assumptions, and how can I mitigate their effects to ensure a more accurate understanding? These questions warrant deeper research and exploration to refine critical thinking skills and promote a more nuanced view of the world.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or limited perspectives. The next step is to actively seek out diverse viewpoints and engage with new information that challenges my existing beliefs. I will also utilize methods such as journaling or discussion with others to critically evaluate and potentially adjust my assumptions based on these new insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying potentially flawed assumptions because I aim to enhance my decision-making by questioning my current beliefs. This reflects a pattern of seeking improvement through self-awareness and critical thinking. By consistently challenging my assumptions, I'm fostering a habit of open-mindedness and continuous learning, which can lead to more informed and adaptable perspectives."
