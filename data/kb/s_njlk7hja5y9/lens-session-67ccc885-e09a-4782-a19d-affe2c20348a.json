  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see that I'm avoiding confronting certain issues or challenges that may be causing discomfort or anxiety. This could involve personal, professional, or relational problems that I find overwhelming or uncertain about how to address. The problem is clearly a lack of engagement with these issues, possibly due to fear of the outcomes or not knowing where to start.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, what if the problem isn't necessarily about avoiding issues due to fear or uncertainty, but rather about prioritizing time and energy on what is most meaningful or impactful right now? Instead of viewing avoidance as a negative, consider it a strategic choice to focus on what's currently manageable or beneficial, allowing you to conserve resources for when you're better prepared to tackle more challenging problems. This reframing shifts the focus from avoidance to intentional prioritization and resource management.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge: How can I better identify the underlying reasons for avoiding certain issues? What strategies or tools can I employ to gradually build resilience and confidence in addressing these challenges? This deserves deeper investigation into psychological and behavioral patterns that contribute to avoidance, as well as exploring techniques for effective prioritization and stress management to balance immediate needs with long-term problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding may stem from either fear or uncertainty, but I recognize the need to prioritize effectively. As a next step, I will identify one specific issue I've been avoiding and allocate a set time to explore it using journaling or talking it out with a trusted friend. This will help clarify my thoughts and develop a manageable action plan to address the issue gradually.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, I realize that I'm examining my thought patterns to understand why I'm avoiding certain issues. This reflects a pattern of seeking to understand and optimize my cognitive and emotional resources rather than confronting discomfort head-on. This perspective aligns with a broader strategy of self-awareness and prioritization, helping me navigate complex challenges more effectively by acknowledging my current limitations and strengths."
