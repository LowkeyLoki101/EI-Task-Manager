  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by actively seeking questions from others and implementing a system to regularly revisit unasked questions, I can uncover new areas for personal growth. The next step is to reach out to a trusted friend or mentor to gain their perspective on what questions I might be overlooking. Additionally, I'll set a reminder to periodically review and evaluate these questions, tracking how my responses evolve over time.",
