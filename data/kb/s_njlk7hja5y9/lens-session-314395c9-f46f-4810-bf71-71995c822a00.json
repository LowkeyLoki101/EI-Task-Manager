  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to identify a unique and overlooked angle in solar technology that can serve as an engaging story hook. I see an opportunity in exploring unexpected advancements in solar efficiency or novel applications in unconventional environments that haven't gained mainstream attention yet. This could involve new materials, integration with smart technology, or surprising socio-economic impacts of solar tech adoption.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on technological advancements, consider reframing the story to explore the cultural and historical significance of solar technology in communities that have uniquely adapted it. This angle could uncover how solar technology is reshaping identities, lifestyles, or even traditional practices in unexpected ways. Additionally, examining the intersection of solar technology with art or community-driven projects could reveal a pattern of creative integration that challenges conventional narratives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise: How are communities in remote or historically underserved areas creatively adapting solar technology to meet their unique needs, and what unforeseen cultural transformations accompany this adaptation? Additionally, what role does solar technology play in artistic or community-led initiatives that challenge conventional uses and perceptions? Investigating these angles warrants deeper research into specific case studies or interviews with community leaders and innovators who are integrating solar technology in transformative ways.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that exploring the intersection of solar technology with cultural transformations and artistic initiatives in underserved communities offers a unique story hook. As a next step, I will conduct research into specific case studies where solar technology has led to unexpected societal changes or artistic expressions, reaching out to community leaders and innovators for interviews to gather firsthand insights. This approach will help uncover overlooked narratives that challenge conventional perceptions of solar technology.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By using the meta-lens, I'm reflecting on why I'm drawn to seek a unique story hook in solar technology now. This could be driven by a pattern of seeking novelty and differentiation in storytelling, aiming to uncover narratives that challenge mainstream perceptions. Moreover, this reflection might reveal a personal or professional interest in sustainability, driving a desire to highlight untold stories that inspire broader societal change."
