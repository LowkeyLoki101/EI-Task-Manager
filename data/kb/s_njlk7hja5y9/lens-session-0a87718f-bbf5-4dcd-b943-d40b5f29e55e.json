  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about identifying unexpected discoveries or insights. Specifically, it involves considering scenarios or information that would be surprising or unforeseen based on current knowledge or assumptions. The focus is on uncovering these surprises and understanding their implications or causes.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on what would surprise you, you considered what has already surprised others in similar situations? By examining past surprises that others have encountered, you might identify patterns or insights that reveal potential surprises for you. Alternatively, consider how intentionally seeking out environments or experiences outside your usual sphere could lead to unexpected discoveries that challenge your assumptions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What methodologies can be developed to systematically identify surprising discoveries or insights, and how can they be integrated into various fields of study or industries? Additionally, how might technology, such as AI-driven analytics, be used to predict or highlight potential surprises by analyzing vast amounts of data for anomalies or patterns that deviate from the norm? These questions warrant deeper investigation to enhance our ability to anticipate and leverage unexpected findings.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by exploring environments and experiences outside my usual sphere, or by analyzing data through AI-driven analytics, I can uncover unexpected discoveries that challenge my assumptions. The next step is to implement a systematic approach to identify these surprises, possibly by reviewing case studies of past surprises in similar scenarios or leveraging technology to detect anomalies. I'll start by researching methodologies used in various fields to anticipate surprises and consider how they can be adapted to my context.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this trigger because I am seeking to break out of my current cognitive patterns and discover insights that challenge my existing assumptions. This approach often repeats a pattern of seeking novelty and surprise to stimulate learning and adaptation. By questioning what surprises me, I am attempting to uncover gaps in my understanding or blind spots that I might not consciously recognize."
