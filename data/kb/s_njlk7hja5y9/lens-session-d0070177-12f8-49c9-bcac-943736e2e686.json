  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could catch me off guard. It involves exploring areas or information that challenge my current assumptions or reveal something previously unknown to me. The goal is to pinpoint what would truly be surprising and why it would be so.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what surprises might emerge from external discoveries, consider what internal revelations could be unexpected. What if the surprising element is not an unknown fact but an introspective realization about your own beliefs, biases, or capabilities? This reframing shifts the focus from external to internal exploration, possibly revealing hidden aspects of your personality or mindset that you hadn't previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Using the recursive lens, one could explore the layers of surprise by asking what underlying beliefs or assumptions might be challenged by a surprising discovery. This leads to questioning how these beliefs were formed and what influences shaped them, prompting further investigation into personal history, cultural influences, or cognitive biases. Additionally, one could delve into the implications of such a surprising discovery on future decisions or perspectives, considering how it might catalyze further unexpected insights or changes in behavior.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that exploring unexpected internal revelations could yield surprising insights about my own beliefs and biases. As a next step, I will dedicate time for introspective reflection, possibly through journaling or meditation, to uncover these potential internal surprises. This process will help identify areas where my assumptions might be challenged, leading to personal growth and a deeper understanding of my mindset.",
