  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can serve as a tool to enhance cognitive flexibility and foster unexpected insights. My next step is to create a structured experiment where I periodically shuffle a set of prompts and document the new questions and ideas that arise.
