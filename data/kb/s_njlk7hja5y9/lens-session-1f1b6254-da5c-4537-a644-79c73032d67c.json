  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected findings or discoveries that could challenge current assumptions or beliefs. I see the need to focus on areas or topics where my knowledge is limited or where recent developments could have led to surprising outcomes. This involves being open to new information that contradicts existing understanding or reveals novel insights.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from a different perspective, consider what unexpected findings might arise if you approached the problem from the viewpoint of someone with different expertise or cultural background. What insights or surprises might emerge if you engaged with the topic as a beginner or as an expert in an unrelated field? This shift could uncover biases in your current understanding and highlight overlooked areas ripe for discovery.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new areas of study or fields could potentially reveal surprising findings that contradict my current understanding or challenge my assumptions? Are there recent technological advancements or scientific discoveries that have not yet been widely disseminated, which could alter existing paradigms? Further investigation could involve exploring interdisciplinary research, examining emerging technologies, and engaging with diverse cultural perspectives to uncover unexpected insights.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected findings are most likely to emerge from engaging with interdisciplinary research and exploring recent technological advancements. As a next step, I will actively seek out and review recent publications or studies from fields outside my current expertise, and attend webinars or conferences on emerging technologies to uncover potential surprises that could challenge my current understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger right now because I'm seeking to challenge my current assumptions and expand my understanding, which is a pattern I often repeat when trying to innovate or solve complex problems. I tend to approach topics with a curiosity-driven mindset, looking for gaps or contradictions in my knowledge. This pattern can lead to breakthroughs but also risks overlooking familiar areas that might hold unexpected surprises if revisited with fresh perspectives."
