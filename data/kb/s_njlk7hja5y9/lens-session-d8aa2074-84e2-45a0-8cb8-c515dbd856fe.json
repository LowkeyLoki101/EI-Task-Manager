  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern that others seem to overlook. This involves recognizing a consistent trend or behavior that stands out to you but is not widely acknowledged or understood by others in your environment. The key is to articulate and validate this pattern to determine its significance and potential impact.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the recurring pattern that you keep noticing is not just about others missing it, but about how your unique perspective allows you to see it differently? This could mean that instead of focusing on the lack of recognition from others, you could explore how your distinct experiences and insights enable you to identify these patterns. By shifting the focus from validation by others to enhancing your own understanding and application of these patterns, you might uncover new opportunities for innovation or leadership.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring this pattern further, consider the potential reasons why others might be missing it. Could it be due to cognitive biases, lack of exposure, or differing priorities? Additionally, investigate how this pattern interacts with broader trends or systemic issues, and whether these insights could lead to innovative solutions or strategic advantages. This deeper analysis might reveal new areas of research or collaboration to enhance your understanding and application of the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my unique perspective allows me to see patterns that others might overlook due to cognitive biases or differing priorities. The next step is to validate this pattern by gathering data and feedback from diverse sources to test its significance and impact. I will also explore potential applications of this pattern in my work or community, aiming to leverage it for innovative solutions or strategic advantages.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about the pattern I keep seeing that others might be missing because it reflects a deeper need to utilize my unique perspective to contribute meaningfully, potentially leading to innovation or growth. This pattern of focusing on what others overlook might be a recurring theme in my approach, driven by a desire to validate my insights and differentiate myself. Recognizing this pattern could help me shift towards leveraging these insights for personal development rather than seeking external validation."
