  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying and questioning assumptions that may not be accurate or valid. I see a need to critically evaluate underlying beliefs or premises that guide my decisions or perceptions. The focus should be on recognizing specific assumptions and assessing their validity to ensure they are not leading to incorrect conclusions or actions.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, consider reframing the situation by asking, \"What new perspectives or information could challenge my current beliefs?\" This approach encourages openness to alternative viewpoints and fosters a mindset geared towards discovery rather than just correction. Additionally, think about how these assumptions impact others and whether their experiences might offer insights that could reshape your understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What assumptions are others around me making that I might be unaware of, and how do these influence our collective understanding or decision-making processes? Additionally, how do my assumptions interact with or oppose the assumptions held by others, and what can be learned from these interactions? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play and uncover hidden biases or perspectives that deserve further investigation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be based on outdated or incomplete information. My next step is to actively seek feedback from diverse perspectives and gather new data to reassess these assumptions. I will also engage in discussions with others to identify any collective assumptions that might be influencing our decisions and consider how these could be updated or challenged.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about challenging my assumptions right now because I recognize repeating patterns of potentially limited perspective in my decision-making process. This approach reflects a broader pattern of striving for accuracy and inclusivity in my understanding, which may stem from a desire to avoid errors or biases in my judgments. By questioning these assumptions, I aim to foster a mindset that is more open to diverse viewpoints and adaptable to change."
