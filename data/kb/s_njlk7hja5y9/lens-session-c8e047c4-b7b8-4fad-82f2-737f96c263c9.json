  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as a curiosity-driven exploration to identify unexpected findings or insights. The challenge is to pinpoint elements or information that deviate from assumptions or norms, leading to surprise. This involves examining current knowledge or situations to identify gaps or anomalies that could lead to surprising discoveries.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the trigger by considering it from an emotional perspective: \"What emotions would I feel if I encountered an unexpected discovery?\" This shifts the focus from merely identifying surprising elements to understanding the emotional impact and personal significance of such discoveries. It encourages you to think about how surprise might alter your perception or decision-making, adding a human dimension to the exploration of the unknown.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to further inquiries about the nature of surprise itself: What underlying assumptions do I hold that could be challenged by new discoveries? How do I differentiate between a surprising and a predictable finding? This exploration could also include investigating the sources of surprise across different domains or contexts—scientific, personal, or societal—and understanding how these insights might influence future expectations, perceptions, or research directions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from challenging existing assumptions or encountering unexpected patterns. As a next step, I will actively seek out situations or information that contradict my current beliefs or knowledge, possibly by engaging with diverse sources or perspectives. This approach will help broaden my understanding and prepare me for potential surprises in various domains.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about what would surprise me to identify potential gaps or anomalies in my current understanding, driven by a pattern of curiosity and a desire for deeper insights. This approach often involves a pattern where I seek unexpected elements to challenge my assumptions and broaden my perspective, reflecting a habitual pattern of questioning and exploration in my thinking process."
