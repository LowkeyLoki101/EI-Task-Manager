  "frameStep": "I see a problem of avoidance or procrastination related to addressing a specific issue in my life. This might involve a personal, professional, or emotional challenge that I find daunting or uncomfortable to confront directly. The key is to identify what exactly I'm avoiding and understand why it feels challenging to address.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing this as avoidance or procrastination, consider it as an opportunity for growth and self-awareness. What if the problem you're avoiding is actually a gateway to discovering new strengths or insights about yourself? By approaching it as a chance to learn and evolve, you may find motivation to tackle the issue with curiosity rather than fear.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying beliefs or fears that make this problem feel so daunting? Are there patterns of avoidance in other areas of my life that connect to this issue? Exploring these questions could reveal deeper psychological or emotional factors influencing my reluctance. Additionally, what resources or support systems could I leverage to help me address this problem more effectively?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I'm avoiding a problem that feels overwhelming due to underlying fears or beliefs about my capability to handle it.

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because it is a recurring pattern in which I tend to sidestep issues that seem overwhelming or uncomfortable, leading to a cycle of avoidance that ultimately hinders my progress. By recognizing this pattern, I can explore deeper motivations and fears that drive this behavior, allowing me to develop strategies to break the cycle and approach challenges more constructively. This thought process is an opportunity to improve my emotional intelligence and resilience."
