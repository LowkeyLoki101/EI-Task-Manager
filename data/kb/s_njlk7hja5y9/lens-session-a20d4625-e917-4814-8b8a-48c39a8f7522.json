  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying a potentially overlooked aspect of my life or thought process by asking myself a question I haven't considered recently. This involves reflecting on areas of my life that may have been neglected or assumed stable, in order to uncover new insights or areas for growth. The goal is to identify and address these areas to foster personal development or solve lingering issues.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on questions I haven't asked myself, what if I reframed this as an opportunity to explore assumptions I've been making unconsciously? By identifying beliefs or routines I've taken for granted, I might discover areas ripe for change or innovation. This shift in perspective could lead to fresh insights and open up new pathways for growth and exploration.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this further, what specific areas of my life have I assumed to be stable, and how might questioning these assumptions reveal hidden opportunities or challenges? Additionally, what past experiences or decisions could hold untapped lessons if reconsidered with a fresh perspective? These inquiries might prompt deeper research into current habits or beliefs, potentially unveiling areas for significant personal or professional growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by examining areas of my life where I've assumed stability, I can uncover new opportunities for growth or improvement. The next step is to deliberately question one specific routine or belief I typically take for granted each week, reflecting on its relevance and potential for change. This will involve a journal exercise to document insights and plan any necessary adjustments or explorations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it reflects a pattern of seeking self-awareness and continuous personal growth by questioning the status quo of my internal dialogue. This approach often involves revisiting neglected areas of thought or life to ensure I'm not stagnating or missing opportunities for improvement. By using a meta-lens, I recognize a recurring tendency to challenge my assumptions and beliefs, which is crucial for remaining adaptable and open to new experiences or insights."
