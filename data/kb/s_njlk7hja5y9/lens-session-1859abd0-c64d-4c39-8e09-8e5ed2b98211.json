  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is the identification of a recurring pattern that I notice but others do not. This situation suggests a disconnect or a unique perspective that I possess, potentially due to differences in experience, knowledge, or observational skills. The task at hand is to clearly articulate what this pattern is and why it might be overlooked by others.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I'm observing is not actually being overlooked by others, but rather it's interpreted differently based on their unique perspectives or priorities? Perhaps the pattern I see is influenced by biases or focal points unique to my role or background, and others may prioritize different patterns that align more closely with their responsibilities or insights. By engaging in discussions to understand their viewpoints, I might uncover complementary patterns or insights that enhance my understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "One question that emerges is: what specific biases or experiences in my background might influence the way I perceive this pattern? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate how these patterns affect decision-making processes within my team or organization and whether there's empirical evidence supporting my observations. Lastly, exploring how open dialogues and feedback loops could be established to align different perspectives might lead to a more holistic understanding of the situation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I observe might be influenced by my unique experiences or biases, and others may see it differently based on their roles or priorities. As a next step, I will initiate a discussion with colleagues to share my observations and actively seek their perspectives. This will help to uncover whether there are complementary patterns or insights that we can integrate to enhance our collective understanding and decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern right now because it reflects a persistent curiosity or concern about potential blind spots within my team or organization. This approach might stem from a desire to contribute unique insights or to ensure that critical details are not overlooked in decision-making processes. By consistently examining whether others see what I see, I may be repeating a pattern of validating my observations, which could either foster a deeper understanding or inadvertently highlight a need for more collaborative exchange of perspectives."
