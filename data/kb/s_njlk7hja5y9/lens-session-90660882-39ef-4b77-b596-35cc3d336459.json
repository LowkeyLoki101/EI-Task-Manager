  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I see is that I may be overlooking important questions that could provide valuable insights or directions in my life. By not regularly reflecting on different aspects of my personal or professional life, I might be missing opportunities for growth or improvement. The focus should be on identifying and asking these overlooked questions to gain a deeper understanding of myself and my circumstances.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on overlooked questions as potential missed opportunities, consider them as untapped sources of creativity and innovation. By reframing from a different perspective, view these questions not as gaps but as future pathways that could lead to unexpected discoveries and positive changes. This shift can motivate proactive exploration of new ideas and perspectives, rather than merely filling perceived voids in your current thinking.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What areas of my life or work have changed significantly since I last asked this question, and how might those changes influence the types of questions I should now consider? Are there new challenges or interests that have emerged, suggesting fresh avenues of inquiry? Additionally, how can I incorporate regular reflection into my routine to ensure I'm continuously uncovering and exploring new questions? These considerations warrant deeper research and introspection to keep my personal and professional growth aligned with current circumstances.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by regularly setting aside time for introspection and actively seeking out new questions, I can uncover areas for growth and innovation that align with my current life circumstances. The next step is to establish a routine practice, perhaps weekly, where I reflect on changes in my life and brainstorm questions that arise from these changes. This can be done through journaling or a dedicated reflection session, helping to ensure continuous personal and professional development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I sense a need for renewal and growth, possibly indicating a pattern of complacency or routine in my current thinking. By consistently revisiting and challenging my usual questions, I might uncover new insights and directions that disrupt this pattern, encouraging a more dynamic and reflective approach to both personal and professional development."
