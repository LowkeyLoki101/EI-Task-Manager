  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying a unique and overlooked pattern within the field of solar technology that can serve as a compelling story hook. This requires analyzing current trends, innovations, or data points in solar technology to uncover an unexpected insight or development that hasn't been widely recognized or discussed. The goal is to find an angle that not only captures attention but also adds a fresh perspective to the discourse on solar advancements.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on the technological advancements, I approached the story from a socio-cultural perspective? For instance, I could investigate how solar technology is impacting communities in unexpected ways, such as revitalizing local economies or altering cultural practices in regions previously reliant on traditional energy sources. This angle could reveal a pattern of change and adaptation that highlights the human element in the solar technology narrative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the long-term socio-economic impacts of solar technology on rural communities, and are there emerging patterns of economic independence or shifts in social dynamics? How might the integration of solar technology influence global migration patterns, particularly in areas severely affected by climate change? Further investigation could also explore how solar technology is altering educational opportunities in off-grid regions, potentially leading to a new wave of innovation and local entrepreneurship.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there is an untapped story in how solar technology is transforming socio-economic landscapes in rural and off-grid communities, fostering economic independence and altering social dynamics. My next step will be to conduct interviews with residents, local leaders, and entrepreneurs in these areas, and gather data on economic and educational developments attributed to solar adoption. This will help build a narrative that highlights the human impact and unexpected benefits of solar technology.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking a fresh angle in solar technology storytelling that hasn't been over-explored, aiming to capture attention and spark new discussions. This reflects a pattern of looking beyond the obvious technological advancements to uncover deeper, often socio-cultural narratives that resonate on a human level, which could lead to more impactful storytelling. By stepping back, I realize that my approach often involves connecting technological trends with their broader implications, suggesting a need to continually explore intersections between technology and society."
