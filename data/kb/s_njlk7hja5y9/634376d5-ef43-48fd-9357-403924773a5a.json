  "content": "Generated from lens processing: Based on the reframed focus on desired outcomes and the recursive analysis of potential limitations, my next step is to clearly define the specific questions or problems that the new data needs to address. Once these are established, I will evaluate whether a simulation is the most appropriate approach or if alternative methods might be more effective. If a simulation is deemed suitable, I will then identify key assumptions and variables to develop a model that accurately reflects the conditions necessary to generate relevant data.",
