  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem to address is identifying a question that I haven't considered recently, which could provide new insights or perspectives. This involves reflecting on areas of my life, interests, or goals that may have been overlooked or neglected. The aim is to uncover an important or thought-provoking question that can lead to personal growth or a fresh understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of searching for a question you haven't asked yourself recently, consider what assumptions you're operating under that haven't been questioned in a while. By challenging these underlying assumptions, you might discover new questions that are even more profound and impactful. This shift in focus could lead to deeper insights and more significant personal growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the assumptions you haven't questioned in a while, you might ask: \"What beliefs do I hold about my capabilities or limitations that need re-evaluation?\" or \"How have my priorities shifted without conscious reflection?\" These questions can lead to deeper investigation into how your self-perception and goals have evolved, potentially uncovering areas where personal growth or change is needed. Further research could involve engaging in reflective practices or seeking feedback from others to identify and challenge these assumptions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by challenging my current assumptions about my capabilities and limitations, I can uncover deeper, more meaningful questions that drive personal growth. The next step is to engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or seeking feedback from trusted peers, to identify these assumptions and explore how they align with my current priorities and self-perception. This process will help me formulate new questions that lead to actionable insights and growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I sense there's untapped potential in exploring areas of my life that I've unintentionally sidelined. This pattern of seeking out new questions often stems from a desire for growth and avoiding stagnation. By consistently revisiting my assumptions and questioning them, I aim to break the cycle of complacency and foster continuous development."
