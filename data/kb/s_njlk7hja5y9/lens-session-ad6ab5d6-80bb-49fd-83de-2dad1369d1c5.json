  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an opportunity to reverse-engineer a solution by starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to identify the necessary steps to achieve it. This approach could reveal overlooked assumptions and dependencies, offering a fresh perspective and potentially uncovering more efficient or innovative solutions. By framing the problem in this way, I can systematically deconstruct the process and understand the key components and their relationships in achieving the final goal.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on the desired outcome, I reframe the problem by considering the obstacles or failures that could prevent success? By identifying potential pitfalls first, I can work backwards to develop strategies that preemptively address these issues, creating a more robust plan. This perspective shifts the focus from merely achieving the goal to also ensuring resilience against setbacks.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, new questions arise about the dependencies and assumptions inherent in the desired outcome. For instance, what specific conditions must be in place at each step to ensure the success of the subsequent steps? Additionally, this approach prompts deeper investigation into alternative pathways: are there different sequences or parallel processes that might lead to the same result, potentially more efficiently? Exploring these questions could reveal hidden efficiencies or innovative methods for achieving the goal.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will reveal overlooked assumptions and dependencies, providing a clearer path to the desired outcome. As a next step, I will map out the desired outcome and trace backwards to identify key steps and potential pitfalls, ensuring that I address these proactively in my solution strategy. This process will also include exploring alternative pathways to achieve the same result, potentially uncovering more efficient methods.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because it's a method that disrupts my usual linear problem-solving pattern, encouraging a more creative and comprehensive exploration of solutions. This approach reflects a recurring pattern in my thinking where I aim to challenge conventional methods and uncover deeper insights by examining the problem from a non-traditional angle. By doing this, I seek to not only achieve the goal but also to enhance resilience and adaptability in my planning."
