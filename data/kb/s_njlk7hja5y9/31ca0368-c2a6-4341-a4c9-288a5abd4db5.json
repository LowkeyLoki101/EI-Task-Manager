  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by systematically shuffling and analyzing my own prompts, I can uncover recurring themes and cognitive biases that shape my thinking. As a next step, I will create a tool or method to shuffle prompts and track the emerging patterns over time. This will help me gain deeper insights into my thought processes and potentially identify areas for creative exploration or personal growth.",
