  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by actively questioning my assumptions and embracing a mindset of curiosity, I can uncover potential errors and gain a more accurate understanding of various situations. As a next step, I will identify specific assumptions I hold in a current project or decision, and actively seek out diverse perspectives and evidence that challenge these assumptions.
