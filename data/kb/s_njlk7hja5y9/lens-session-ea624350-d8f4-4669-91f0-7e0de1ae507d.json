  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content. I see the need to capture the audience's attention quickly with a relevant and engaging narrative. The goal is to create a hook that resonates with the target audience's current interests and needs, driving engagement and fostering a connection with the brand.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached the story hook from the perspective of the audience's emotional journey rather than just their interests? Instead of focusing solely on what might currently capture their attention, consider what emotions or experiences they are navigating today and create a story hook that offers validation, solace, or empowerment. This angle can deepen engagement by aligning the content with the emotional states and transitions your audience is experiencing.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the current emotional trends or societal events that could be influencing my target audience's experiences today? How can I research or gather insights into these emotions to tailor my story hook effectively? Additionally, what platforms or mediums are most effective for delivering this emotionally resonant content to ensure it reaches and engages the intended audience?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that today's story hook should focus on the emotional impact of recent societal events, such as a significant cultural moment or a widely shared experience. To develop this, I will research current news, social media trends, and community conversations to identify these emotional threads. Next, I will craft a narrative that aligns with these emotions and choose the most effective platform to share this content, ensuring it resonates deeply with the target audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this trigger because there's an immediate need to align marketing efforts with today's dynamic audience landscape, ensuring that content remains relevant and engaging. This reflects a pattern of seeking to continually adapt and refine strategies to maintain a competitive edge and foster deeper audience connections. By using a meta-lens, I recognize the importance of understanding broader patterns in audience behavior and emotional states, allowing for a more holistic approach to storytelling that transcends mere trends and taps into enduring human experiences."
