  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is the need to identify an important, yet overlooked, question that hasn't been considered in a while. This involves reflecting on aspects of life, goals, or personal development that might need attention or reevaluation. The goal is to uncover a potentially valuable inquiry that could lead to new insights or actions.",
  "reframeStep": "From a completely different perspective, consider not just the questions you haven't asked yourself, but the ones you haven't dared to ask. What are the uncomfortable or challenging questions that you might have been avoiding? By focusing on these, you might uncover deeper insights that drive significant personal growth or life changes, leading you to confront areas of your life that need attention but have been overshadowed by more immediate concerns.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What areas of my life have I not only neglected to question but also failed to explore due to fear of the unknown or discomfort? What are the long-term implications of not addressing these areas, and how might they affect my personal and professional growth? Investigating the potential outcomes of these unasked questions could guide deeper research into self-improvement strategies and motivate proactive steps towards change.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and confronting the uncomfortable or challenging questions I've been avoiding, I can uncover areas of my life that need critical attention and potential growth. The next step is to intentionally set aside time for reflection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to explore these unasked questions and their implications. This deliberate introspection will help me prioritize areas for personal development and set actionable goals to address them.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because itâ€™s important to periodically reflect on neglected areas of life to ensure balanced growth and fulfillment. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on immediate concerns while avoiding deeper, possibly uncomfortable questions that could lead to meaningful change. By recognizing this, I can consciously make space for these important reflections and address any underlying issues."
