  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential creativity and insights that can arise from rearranging and combining existing prompts in new ways. By shuffling prompts, I aim to generate fresh perspectives and innovative questions that might not have been previously considered. This process can help break routine thinking patterns and stimulate novel ideas.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the prompts themselves, consider the process of shuffling as a metaphor for adaptability and flexibility in thinking. What if the act of shuffling prompts is less about finding new questions and more about training the mind to be comfortable with change and uncertainty? This perspective shifts the goal from generating new content to developing cognitive agility and openness to unexpected insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the idea of shuffling prompts, new questions emerge about the nature of creativity and the mechanisms behind innovative thought processes. For instance, how does randomness influence cognitive pathways, and what role does serendipity play in creative breakthroughs? Additionally, deeper investigation could explore how different disciplines utilize randomness and reconfiguration in problem-solving, potentially revealing universal strategies for enhancing creativity across fields.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can serve as a tool to enhance cognitive flexibility and foster unexpected insights. My next step is to create a structured experiment where I periodically shuffle a set of prompts and document the new questions and ideas that arise. This will help me assess the impact of randomness on my creative thinking and identify any patterns or themes that consistently emerge.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts right now to challenge and expand my creative process, potentially disrupting habitual thought patterns. This reflects a broader pattern of seeking innovation through reorganization and variation, indicating a tendency to value adaptability and the exploration of new perspectives as a way to enhance cognitive flexibility. This approach suggests an underlying belief that transformation and novelty can be achieved through reconfiguring existing elements."
