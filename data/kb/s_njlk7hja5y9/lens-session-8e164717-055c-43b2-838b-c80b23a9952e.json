  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring creativity and generating fresh insights by reordering existing prompts. By shuffling the prompts, you can discover unexpected connections and perspectives, potentially leading to innovative ideas or solutions that weren't initially apparent. This approach encourages breaking free from routine thinking patterns and embracing a more dynamic and flexible mindset.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing shuffling prompts as a method to generate new ideas, consider it as a way to uncover subconscious patterns or themes in your thinking. By rearranging prompts, you might reveal underlying biases or recurring topics that you were unaware of, providing an opportunity to address them. This approach shifts the focus from solely generating new ideas to also gaining deeper self-awareness and understanding of your mental processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What patterns or biases become evident when I repeatedly shuffle my prompts? How do different configurations of prompts influence my emotional or cognitive responses? Investigating these questions could lead to deeper insights into my personal thinking style and open avenues for developing tailored creative strategies that leverage these patterns effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts will not only generate new ideas but also reveal underlying cognitive patterns and biases. The next step is to actively shuffle my prompts and document the outcomes, noting any recurring themes or emotional responses. This process will help me refine my creative strategies and enhance self-awareness in my thinking style.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now as a way to break free from habitual thinking patterns and to explore new creative avenues. This reflects a recurring pattern in my approach where I seek novelty and innovation by rearranging existing elements to gain fresh insights. By recognizing this pattern, I can be more intentional in using this method not just for creativity, but also as a tool for self-reflection to understand my thought processes better."
