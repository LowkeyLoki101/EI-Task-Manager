  "trigger": "What's happening in my industry that I should be paying attention to?",
  "frameStep": "In your industry, it is crucial to pay attention to emerging technologies, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer behavior. These factors can significantly impact market dynamics, competitive landscapes, and operational strategies. Identifying these trends early can help you adapt and innovate effectively to maintain or gain a competitive edge.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on external changes like emerging technologies or regulatory shifts, consider reframing the question to examine internal dynamics within your organization or industry. What are the existing strengths and weaknesses in your operational strategies or business models that could be leveraged or need addressing to better respond to these external changes? By shifting the focus inward, you might uncover opportunities for internal innovation or process improvement that could be equally impactful in staying competitive.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider diving deeper into how emerging technologies and regulatory changes interact with each other and influence consumer behavior in your industry. Investigate how these external factors might create opportunities for collaboration with other industries or sectors. Additionally, explore how your organization's internal strengths and weaknesses can be aligned to not only adapt to these external changes but also drive innovation, potentially leading to new business models or market opportunities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on how emerging technologies, regulatory changes, and consumer behavior intersect, I can uncover strategic opportunities for my organization. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of these factors, both externally and internally, to identify potential areas for innovation and collaboration. I will initiate a cross-departmental workshop to gather insights and align our strengths with these market dynamics to formulate a responsive strategy.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Right now, I'm exploring this topic to ensure I remain relevant and competitive in my industry by proactively identifying trends and changes. The pattern I tend to repeat is focusing primarily on external factors without balancing that attention with an introspective evaluation of my organization's capabilities and processes. By adopting a meta-lens, I can better understand how my strategic thinking influences my ability to respond to industry changes and whether I need to adjust my approach to include a more holistic view that considers both internal and external dynamics."
