  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a question that has been neglected or overlooked in my self-reflection process. I see the need to delve into areas of personal growth, goals, or concerns that I may have unintentionally sidelined, to gain fresh insights or perspective on my current life situation. This involves considering aspects of my life that require more attention or exploration.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked, I consider areas of my life where I feel stagnant or dissatisfied, and then identify the questions that could unlock progress in those areas? Alternatively, I could explore questions that challenge my current beliefs or assumptions, potentially leading to transformative insights. By shifting the perspective from neglected questions to areas ripe for exploration, I might discover new paths for growth and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively, one might ask: What are the underlying reasons or patterns that lead me to neglect certain questions about myself? Additionally, how might regularly revisiting neglected areas of reflection impact my personal growth over time? Delving deeper into these inquiries could uncover habits or fears that prevent self-exploration and reveal strategies for maintaining a more comprehensive and balanced approach to self-reflection.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I haven't been asking questions that challenge my current beliefs or assumptions, potentially hindering deeper personal growth. As a next step, I will set aside dedicated time each week to reflect on areas where I feel stagnant or dissatisfied and formulate specific questions aimed at exploring those areas more deeply. This practice will help uncover fresh insights and facilitate ongoing personal development.",

This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking depth in self-reflection, suggesting I consistently strive for personal development and self-awareness. By acknowledging this pattern, I can consciously choose to embrace it and explore new, potentially transformative questions."
