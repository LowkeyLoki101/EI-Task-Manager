  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a surprising pattern in solar technology that hasn't been widely recognized or explored, which could serve as a unique and compelling story hook. This involves examining current trends, advancements, or unexpected applications of solar technology that could captivate an audience and offer new insights. The goal is to uncover an angle that highlights innovation, challenges preconceived notions, or reveals an overlooked impact of solar technology.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on technological or scientific advancements, consider exploring the socio-economic or cultural impact of solar technology in unexpected communities. For instance, investigate how solar innovations are transforming remote or impoverished regions, enabling unexpected industries or cultural shifts. This angle not only highlights the technology's broader implications but also humanizes the narrative, making it relatable and compelling.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific socio-economic changes occurring in communities adopting solar technology, and how do these changes differ from those in areas relying on traditional energy sources? How is solar technology influencing cultural practices or local economies in ways that are not immediately apparent, such as shifts in employment patterns or new educational opportunities? Investigating these questions could reveal underreported narratives and potential long-term impacts of solar adoption, offering a fresh perspective on its role in global development.",
  "closureStep": "My current working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in exploring how solar technology is catalyzing socio-economic transformations in unexpected communities, particularly focusing on the shifts in employment patterns, cultural practices, and educational opportunities. The next step is to conduct targeted research or interviews in regions where solar technology adoption is significantly impacting local economies and cultures, aiming to uncover specific narratives and data that illustrate these changes. This approach will help develop a compelling and human-centered story that highlights the broader implications of solar innovation beyond its technological aspects.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm looking to create a story that stands out by revealing an unexpected narrative in the field of solar technology. The pattern I'm repeating is seeking a unique angle by focusing on the less-obvious socio-cultural impacts rather than the more commonly discussed technical aspects. This approach reflects a broader interest in storytelling that connects technology with human experiences and societal change."
