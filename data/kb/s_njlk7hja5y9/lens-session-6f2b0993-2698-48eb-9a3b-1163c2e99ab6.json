  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify a simulation that generates new, relevant data for analysis or decision-making. The challenge is to define the objectives of the simulation, determine what type of data is needed, and select a model or system that can effectively produce this data. This involves understanding the current gaps in data and how new simulations can fill those gaps.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through simulations, consider the possibility of transforming existing data by simulating different scenarios or conditions that have not yet been observed. This approach could uncover new insights and patterns without needing entirely new data. Additionally, think about leveraging simulations to test how changes in certain variables might affect outcomes, thereby generating data that helps to validate or challenge existing models or assumptions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific variables or conditions that, if simulated, could yield data most beneficial for our objectives? How might different simulation frameworks or tools vary in their ability to produce accurate and useful data? Additionally, what are the ethical or practical implications of simulating certain scenarios, and how could these considerations impact our choice of simulation?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that running a simulation focused on varying key variables or conditions relevant to our objectives will yield the most beneficial new data. The next step is to identify the specific variables and select a suitable simulation tool or framework that can accurately model these scenarios. I will also consider any ethical or practical implications of the simulations to ensure responsible data generation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about creating new data through simulations because there is a need to explore and address gaps in our current data set, which might hinder effective decision-making or analysis. This pattern of seeking simulations stems from a proactive approach to problem-solving, where I prefer generating data through hypothetical scenarios rather than relying solely on existing information. By adopting this mindset, I aim to uncover novel insights and validate assumptions, which can lead to more informed and adaptive strategies."
