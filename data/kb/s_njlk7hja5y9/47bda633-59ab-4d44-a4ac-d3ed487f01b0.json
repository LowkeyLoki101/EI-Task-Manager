  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling prompts and examining how they interconnect, I can uncover new themes and insights that enhance creativity and problem-solving. The next step is to create a small experiment where I shuffle a set of prompts, analyze the new combinations for emerging patterns, and document any novel insights or ideas. Additionally, I will explore using AI tools to automate the shuffling process and analyze results for more systematic exploration.",
