  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem of avoidance, where there is something specific that I am consciously or subconsciously choosing not to address. This could be an issue related to work, relationships, personal goals, or health that I might find overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront. By framing the problem, I can start to identify what exactly I am avoiding and why it might be causing discomfort or anxiety.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of viewing this as a problem of avoidance, I consider it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery? From this angle, the issue at hand might not just be something to tackle, but a chance to learn more about my priorities and values. By embracing this perspective, I can approach the situation with curiosity rather than fear, which opens up new possibilities for personal development and resolution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions that emerge include: What are the underlying fears or beliefs that cause me to avoid certain problems? How might avoiding this issue impact other areas of my life, such as my emotional well-being or relationships? It might be worthwhile to investigate techniques for confronting avoidance, such as cognitive behavioral strategies or mindfulness practices, and explore how these can be integrated into my daily routine for better emotional management and problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a problem related to personal growth, possibly due to underlying fears or discomfort about facing change or potential failure. As a next step, I will dedicate time to reflect on my priorities and values, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to better understand the root of my avoidance. Additionally, I will explore cognitive behavioral strategies to develop a practical plan for addressing this issue, integrating these practices into my daily routine to enhance my emotional resilience and problem-solving skills.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this issue of avoidance because it's a recurring pattern where I might habitually sidestep challenges that feel daunting. This reflective exercise is a way to break the cycle of evasion by understanding its root causes and effects on my life. By examining the broader context of why I avoid certain issues, I can develop strategies to face them more constructively, transforming this pattern into an opportunity for growth."
