  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying and challenging any assumptions that may be incorrect or unexamined in a given situation. I see a need to critically evaluate beliefs or perceptions that influence decisions or understanding. This involves pinpointing assumptions and assessing their validity in the current context.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of looking for assumptions that might be wrong, you consider the possibility that some assumptions could be partially correct or contextually relevant, but not universally applicable? This perspective shifts the focus from proving assumptions entirely right or wrong to understanding the nuances and limitations of each assumption. By doing this, you can explore how different contexts might validate or invalidate these assumptions, leading to a more flexible and adaptive approach to decision-making.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of recursive exploration, a new question that emerges is: \"How do the assumptions I hold interact with each other, and could their interplay lead to compounded inaccuracies?\" Additionally, it might be valuable to investigate the origins of these assumptions: \"What past experiences or information led to the formation of these assumptions, and how might they have evolved over time?\" These inquiries could uncover layers of assumptions and offer insights into how they collectively influence decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that assumptions are often context-dependent, and their validity may vary across different situations. The next step is to systematically review my core assumptions, considering both their origins and how they interact with one another. I will take action by documenting these assumptions and examining them within various contexts to identify where they hold true and where they might need adjustment or re-evaluation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about challenging assumptions right now because there's a recurring pattern in my approach where I tend to seek certainty by classifying assumptions as either right or wrong. This pattern limits my perspective by oversimplifying complex issues. Applying a meta-lens helps me recognize this tendency and prompts me to adopt a more nuanced approach, where I explore the contextual validity of assumptions rather than striving for absolute certainty."
