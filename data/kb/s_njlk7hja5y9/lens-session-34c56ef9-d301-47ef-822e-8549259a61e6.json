  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential for creativity and novelty by rearranging existing prompts to generate new questions or insights. This involves taking a collection of prompts and experimenting with different combinations to see what fresh ideas or perspectives emerge. The goal is to discover unique angles or questions that might not have been considered in their original context.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, shuffling prompts can be seen as a way to break free from habitual thinking patterns. Instead of focusing solely on creativity, consider it as an exercise in challenging cognitive biases and assumptions. By disrupting the usual order, you create opportunities to question existing beliefs and approach problems from an entirely new angle, potentially leading to deeper insights or more innovative solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific patterns or themes that emerge when prompts are shuffled, and how do these inform our understanding of our own thought processes or biases? Additionally, what tools or methodologies could be developed to automate and enhance the shuffling process, ensuring a systematic approach to generating novel insights? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of creative thinking and cognitive flexibility.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can reveal unexpected connections and insights that challenge existing thought patterns. As a next step, I will create a systematic process for shuffling my prompts—perhaps using a randomizer tool—to regularly generate new question combinations, allowing me to explore these insights further. This will be complemented by documenting any recurring themes or novel perspectives that arise from this exercise.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because I'm seeking to break out of my usual patterns and discover novel insights. This reflects a pattern of using disruption as a tool for innovation and self-reflection, aiming to challenge my cognitive biases and habitual ways of thinking. By doing this, I'm deliberately creating space for unexpected connections and questioning assumptions that might otherwise go unexamined."
