  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern that I notice but others do not. The core issue is understanding why this pattern is not recognized by othersâ€”whether it's due to a lack of awareness, different perspectives, or missing information. It's essential to clearly articulate and communicate this pattern to others to bridge the gap in perception.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the recurring pattern I notice is not about others missing something, but about me having a unique perspective or insight that others haven't yet developed? Instead of focusing on why others aren't seeing it, I could consider how my experiences or skills have uniquely positioned me to identify this pattern. This approach shifts the focus from a perceived gap in others' understanding to a recognition of my own strengths and the opportunity to share and educate others about this insight.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge: How can I systematically analyze and validate the existence of this pattern through data or further research? What methods can I employ to effectively communicate and demonstrate the significance of this pattern to others? Exploring these questions might involve delving into case studies, gathering empirical evidence, or developing educational tools to effectively share this insight.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my unique perspective allows me to identify patterns that others may not notice due to different experiences or skill sets. The next step is to systematically document and analyze these patterns through data collection and research to verify their validity. I will then develop a strategy to effectively communicate these insights to others, possibly through presentations, workshops, or written reports, to bridge the understanding gap.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I have a strong desire to contribute meaningfully by leveraging my unique insights. This pattern of focusing on what others might be missing may stem from my tendency to seek validation or recognition for my observations. By understanding this, I can redirect my energy towards collaboration and education, using my insights to empower others rather than solely highlighting the disparity in perception."
