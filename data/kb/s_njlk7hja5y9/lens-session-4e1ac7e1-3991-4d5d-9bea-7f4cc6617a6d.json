  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is exploring the potential for new insights or creative outputs by reorganizing existing prompts. By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to discover fresh questions or perspectives that might lead to innovative solutions or ideas. This process could help break habitual thinking patterns and uncover novel connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on the prompts themselves, I considered the process of shuffling as a metaphor for adaptability and flexibility in thinking? By viewing the prompts as elements in a dynamic system, I might explore how changes in sequence and context can lead to new patterns of thought, highlighting the importance of fluidity and openness to change in creative problem-solving. This perspective shifts the focus from the content of the prompts to the transformative power of their arrangement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying principles that determine how new questions or insights emerge from shuffled prompts? Could exploring different methods of shuffling — such as randomization versus intentional thematic grouping — yield varying degrees of novelty or relevance? Additionally, how might technology, such as AI, assist in optimizing the shuffling process to consistently generate valuable new perspectives? These questions warrant deeper investigation into the dynamics of creativity and the role of structure in idea generation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to the emergence of novel insights by introducing new contexts and connections. The next actionable step is to experiment with different methods of shuffling, such as randomization and thematic grouping, to observe which approach yields the most innovative questions or perspectives. Additionally, I will explore using AI tools to enhance this process, potentially automating and optimizing the generation of valuable new prompts.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm seeking to break away from existing thought patterns and uncover new ideas or insights. The pattern I'm repeating is my tendency to rely on established sequences or structures when approaching problems, and by shuffling prompts, I aim to disrupt this pattern to foster creativity and adaptability. This process reflects a broader desire to cultivate a mindset that embraces change and explores the potential of rearranging elements to generate novel outcomes."
