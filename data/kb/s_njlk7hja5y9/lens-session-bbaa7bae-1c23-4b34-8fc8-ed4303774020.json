  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying assumptions that may be incorrect. The focus is on uncovering beliefs or preconceived notions that could be influencing my understanding or actions in a particular situation. This involves being open to questioning and critically evaluating the foundations of my current thinking to identify potential errors or biases.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying which of my assumptions might be wrong, I could reframe the situation by asking, \"What new information or perspective could challenge my current assumptions?\" This shifts the focus from introspection to exploration, encouraging me to seek out diverse viewpoints or evidence that I may have overlooked. By actively seeking alternative perspectives, I open myself up to a broader understanding and reduce the risk of being confined by my existing beliefs.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, new questions that emerge include: \"What sources or methods can I use to validate or invalidate my assumptions?\" and \"How do my assumptions influence my decision-making and behavior?\" These questions deserve deeper investigation, possibly through research into cognitive biases or engaging with diverse perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the assumptions I hold.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases, leading to potential errors in judgment. As a next step, I will actively seek out diverse perspectives and evidence by engaging in discussions with individuals from different backgrounds and consulting varied sources. This exploration will help validate or challenge my assumptions, providing a more balanced and informed viewpoint.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions right now because I aim to ensure my decisions and perceptions are grounded in reality, free from bias or error. This pattern of introspection reflects a broader tendency to question and validate my understanding before proceeding, highlighting a commitment to learning and growth. By consistently seeking to uncover and challenge my assumptions, I am reinforcing a cycle of continuous improvement and adaptability in my problem-solving approach."
