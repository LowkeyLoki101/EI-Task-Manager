  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is a specific issue or challenge that I find uncomfortable or difficult to confront. This could be related to personal relationships, career decisions, health concerns, or financial matters that I prefer not to address because they may require significant effort, change, or confrontation. Identifying this problem clearly is the first step towards addressing it proactively.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something to avoid due to discomfort or difficulty, consider it as an opportunity for growth and learning. What if addressing this issue could lead to personal development, stronger relationships, or enhanced career prospects? By reimagining the problem as a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block, you may find new motivation and strategies to tackle it head-on.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively exploring the problem you're avoiding, consider what underlying fears or beliefs might be contributing to this avoidance. Are there specific past experiences that are shaping your current reluctance to face this issue? Additionally, what smaller, manageable steps could you take to gradually approach the problem, and how might addressing these smaller pieces impact your overall perspective and motivation to resolve the larger issue?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I have been avoiding involves a significant career decision that requires confronting my fears of failure and change. As a next step, I will break down this larger issue into smaller, actionable tasks, such as researching potential career paths, updating my resume, and reaching out to mentors for advice. By setting a timeline to complete these tasks, I can systematically address my concerns and move towards a resolution.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I recognize that I'm thinking about this problem now because it signifies a recurring pattern of avoidance in my approach to challenges. This pattern often manifests as procrastination or deferral, particularly when facing issues that threaten my comfort zone or require substantial emotional or cognitive investment. By identifying this pattern, I can consciously work towards breaking it and adopting a more proactive and solution-focused mindset."
