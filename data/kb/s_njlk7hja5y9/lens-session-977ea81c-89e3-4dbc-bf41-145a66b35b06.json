  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential of generating new insights or ideas by randomly reordering existing prompts. The focus is on understanding how shuffling prompts might lead to novel combinations that could spark creativity or uncover hidden connections. This approach seeks to leverage the unpredictability of shuffled inputs to inspire fresh perspectives.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of merely shuffling prompts to find new ideas, you approached this as a form of creative constraint where the challenge is to connect seemingly unrelated prompts into a coherent narrative or concept? This perspective shifts the focus from randomness to intentional pattern recognition and synthesis, encouraging you to actively seek out relationships and themes that might not be immediately apparent. By viewing it as an exercise in storytelling or problem-solving, you could discover more profound insights and innovative solutions beyond the initial randomness.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What methods or tools can be developed to effectively shuffle and synthesize prompts, ensuring they lead to meaningful insights? How might this approach influence fields like creative writing or brainstorming, and could it be used as a teaching tool to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills? Exploring these questions could uncover strategies for harnessing randomness in structured ways to catalyze innovation across various disciplines.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts and intentionally synthesizing them can lead to meaningful insights and innovations. The next step is to create a system or tool for shuffling prompts, perhaps using software or a physical card deck, and test it in creative writing workshops or brainstorming sessions. This will help evaluate its effectiveness in fostering creativity and critical thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts right now because I'm seeking new perspectives and ways to spark creativity. This approach reflects a pattern of exploring randomness and spontaneity as tools for innovation, suggesting an underlying preference for open-ended exploration over structured analysis. By recognizing this pattern, I can intentionally balance randomness with strategic thinking, ensuring that the insights gained are both novel and applicable."
