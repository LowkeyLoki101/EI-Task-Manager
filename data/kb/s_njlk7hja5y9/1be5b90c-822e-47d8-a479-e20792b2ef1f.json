  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the recurring pattern I identified is an unrecognized asset that can be leveraged for strategic advantage. The next step is to conduct a workshop or brainstorming session with key stakeholders to explore this pattern further, encouraging them to view it as a potential opportunity rather than a problem. This collaborative approach will help generate innovative solutions and strategies that capitalize on this insight.",
