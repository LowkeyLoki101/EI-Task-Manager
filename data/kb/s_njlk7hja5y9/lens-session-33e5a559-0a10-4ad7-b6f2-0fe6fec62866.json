  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a unique and overlooked pattern in solar technology that can serve as a compelling story hook. This involves analyzing current trends, innovations, or adoption rates in the solar industry to find an unexpected angle or pattern that hasn't been widely covered or recognized by others. The goal is to uncover a narrative that highlights this surprising element and engages an audience with its novelty and relevance.",
  "reframeStep": "Consider exploring the intersection of solar technology with other emerging fields like biotechnology or artificial intelligence. Instead of focusing solely on the technology itself, reframe the story to highlight how solar technology is being integrated into unexpected areas, such as solar-powered biosensors or AI-driven solar optimization systems. This angle could reveal a pattern of cross-industry innovation that offers fresh insights and broader implications beyond the solar industry alone.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential implications of integrating solar technology with biotechnology or AI on future energy systems, and how might this reshape industries beyond energy? Additionally, could the societal and environmental impacts of these integrations reveal new ethical considerations or regulatory challenges that deserve deeper investigation? Exploring these questions could uncover new narratives about the evolving role of solar technology in a sustainable future.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the integration of solar technology with biotechnology or AI presents a unique and underexplored narrative about how these fields converge to revolutionize energy systems and broader industries. The next step is to research specific case studies or real-world applications where solar technology intersects with biotech or AI, focusing on both technological advancements and their societal impacts. This approach will help identify a compelling story hook that highlights innovative uses and the potential challenges or ethical considerations involved.",
