  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "I see the potential for generating fresh and unexpected ideas by rearranging existing prompts. This process could lead to novel combinations and insights that weren't initially apparent, encouraging creative thinking and innovation. The direct task is to systematically shuffle the prompts and observe what new questions or concepts arise.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on generating new prompts, consider the act of shuffling as an opportunity to explore your underlying thought patterns and biases. By examining which prompts naturally gravitate towards each other, you might discover recurring themes or areas where your thinking is limited. This perspective shifts the focus from creation to self-reflection, allowing for personal growth and deeper understanding of your cognitive processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific patterns or themes consistently appear when shuffling these prompts, and how might these reveal underlying biases or assumptions in my thinking? Additionally, how can I systematically document and analyze the impact of different prompt combinations on my creative output to further refine and enhance this process? Exploring these questions could lead to more structured methodologies for generating innovative ideas.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts will reveal recurring themes and biases in my thinking, offering opportunities for self-reflection and innovation. As a next step, I will create a systematic approach to shuffle and document the outcomes of these combinations, analyzing any patterns that emerge to refine my creative process and expand my cognitive flexibility.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about shuffling prompts, I'm likely seeking innovation and novelty, which is a pattern I often repeat when faced with creative tasks. This reflects a tendency to disrupt routine thinking to discover fresh insights. Recognizing this pattern can help me balance the desire for novelty with the need for depth and focus in my explorations."
