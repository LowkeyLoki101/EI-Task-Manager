  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by systematically shuffling and analyzing my own prompts, I can uncover recurring themes and cognitive biases that shape my thinking. As a next step, I will create a tool or method to shuffle prompts and track the emerging patterns over time.
