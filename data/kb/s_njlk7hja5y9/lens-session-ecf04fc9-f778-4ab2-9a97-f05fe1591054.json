  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is exploring how rearranging or shuffling my existing prompts can lead to the emergence of new, potentially insightful or creative prompts. This involves examining how different combinations or sequences might unlock fresh perspectives or ideas that weren't apparent in their original order. The goal is to identify whether this process can generate prompts that are more innovative or thought-provoking.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of merely shuffling prompts, I approached the task as a game or creative exercise, where each prompt becomes a piece of a puzzle that can be rearranged to form new narratives or themes? By viewing it as a playful exploration rather than a structured task, I might discover unexpected connections or storylines, leading to innovative prompts that blend different ideas into a cohesive whole. This playful perspective could foster a more open-minded and experimental approach, encouraging creativity and novel insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, what patterns or themes become more apparent, and how might these influence my creative process? Could the act of rearranging prompts uncover subconscious biases or assumptions in how I typically generate ideas? Exploring these questions might reveal deeper insights into how I can use prompt shuffling not just for creativity, but also for self-reflection and understanding my thought patterns.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my prompts can uncover new patterns, themes, and connections that lead to more innovative and insightful ideas. As a next step, I will dedicate time each week to systematically shuffle and experiment with my existing prompts, documenting any new narratives or creative insights that emerge. This practice will not only enhance my creative process but also provide opportunities for self-reflection on my thought patterns and assumptions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm contemplating this because I often seek new perspectives and creativity in my work, and shuffling prompts offers a method to break free from routine thinking patterns. By repeatedly exploring the rearrangement of existing elements, I'm engaging in a pattern of challenging conventional approaches to problem-solving, aiming to discover innovative insights through unconventional methods. This reflection reveals my tendency to experiment with structure as a means of sparking creativity."
