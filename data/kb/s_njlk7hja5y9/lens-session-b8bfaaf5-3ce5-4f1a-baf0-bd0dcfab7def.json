  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as identifying unexpected discoveries that could challenge my current understanding or assumptions. This involves exploring areas or topics where I have preconceived notions and being open to finding evidence or information that contradicts them. The goal is to actively seek out these surprises to broaden my perspective and enhance my learning.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on areas where I have preconceived notions, I could reframe the question to explore entirely new domains that I'm unfamiliar with. By stepping outside my comfort zone and diving into completely different fields or cultures, I might encounter surprises that I couldn't even anticipate from my current perspective. This approach broadens the scope of discovery beyond challenging my existing assumptions to include uncovering entirely new insights and paradigms.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to the question: \"What areas or topics am I completely overlooking in my current exploration that could lead to unexpected discoveries?\" This prompts deeper investigation into fields or subjects I have not yet considered, encouraging a more comprehensive exploration. Additionally, it raises the question of what methodologies or tools I could use to systematically uncover these surprises, such as interdisciplinary studies or collaboration with experts from diverse backgrounds.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries are most likely to emerge from exploring unfamiliar fields and collaborating across disciplines. As a next step, I will identify and engage with experts or resources in a field outside my current expertise to facilitate this exploration. Additionally, I'll seek opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration to broaden the scope of potential surprises.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking to challenge and expand my current understanding by discovering unexpected insights. The pattern I'm repeating is my tendency to focus on known areas where I might have biases or assumptions, rather than exploring entirely new and unfamiliar territories. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously choose to diversify my exploration strategies, embracing uncertainty and novelty in my learning process."
