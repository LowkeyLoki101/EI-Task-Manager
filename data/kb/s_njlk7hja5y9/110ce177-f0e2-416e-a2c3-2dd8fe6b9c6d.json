  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that my current assumptions might be influenced by cognitive biases or incomplete information. As a next step, I will actively seek out diverse perspectives and feedback from others to identify any blind spots in my thinking. Additionally, I will make it a regular practice to reflect on my assumptions and question their validity, potentially incorporating tools like assumption mapping or bias checklists to enhance this process.",
