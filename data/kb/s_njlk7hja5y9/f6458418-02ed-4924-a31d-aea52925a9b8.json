  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to treat the industry trend as an evolving variable within the simulation, allowing for dynamic exploration of its trajectory under various scenarios. The next step is to research and select adaptable simulation techniques that can effectively capture and influence these trends. Additionally, I will investigate the ethical implications of using such simulations to ensure responsible application.",
