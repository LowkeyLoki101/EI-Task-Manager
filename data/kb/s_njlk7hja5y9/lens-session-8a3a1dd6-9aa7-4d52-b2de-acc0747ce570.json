  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea framed here is about uncovering unexpected or surprising information. It's a curiosity-driven inquiry, encouraging exploration beyond current knowledge or assumptions. This could involve discovering unknown facts, hidden patterns, or insights that challenge preconceived notions. The focus is on identifying what elements, if revealed, would defy expectations and provoke a sense of surprise.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the possibility that the surprising element lies not in external discoveries, but within one's own assumptions and biases. What if the surprise stems from realizing that the limitations of our understanding are self-imposed? This angle shifts the focus from seeking external shocks to introspective insights, where the surprise is the newfound awareness of one's own cognitive blind spots and potential for growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, one might ask: what layers of surprise exist beyond the initial discovery? Could there be a deeper, systemic pattern of unexpected findings that, if explored, reveals broader insights about a domain or one's own thought processes? Additionally, what are the secondary and tertiary implications of these surprises on existing theories or beliefs, and how might they prompt further questions about the nature of knowledge and discovery itself?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the most surprising discovery would be uncovering a fundamental assumption I hold that has been limiting my understanding. The next step is to actively seek feedback from diverse perspectives and reflect on my current beliefs to identify any cognitive biases or blind spots. This introspection could lead to a deeper, systemic understanding of the areas I explore.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it encourages exploration and challenges my comfort zone, pushing me to seek out information or insights that disrupt my current understanding. The pattern I might be repeating is the tendency to focus externally for surprises, rather than turning inward to question my assumptions and biases. By using this meta-lens, I can shift my approach to include introspection, recognizing that some of the most significant surprises might come from within my own thought processes and beliefs."
