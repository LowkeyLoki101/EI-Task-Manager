  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that categorizing prompts by themes before shuffling can lead to more structured and insightful innovations. As a next step, I will identify key themes relevant to my field and organize my prompts accordingly. Then, I will experiment with different shuffling methods to observe which combinations yield the most novel and relevant ideas.",
