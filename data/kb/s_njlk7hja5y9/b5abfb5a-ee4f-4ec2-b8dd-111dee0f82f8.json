  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can uncover hidden connections and inspire novel ideas. The next step is to implement a systematic approach to shuffling and analyzing these prompts, perhaps using a software tool or algorithm to ensure randomness and track outcomes. Additionally, I will explore the effects of this exercise in a group setting to evaluate its potential for enhancing collaborative creativity.",
