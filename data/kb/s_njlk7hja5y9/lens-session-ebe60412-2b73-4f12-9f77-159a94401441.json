  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a meaningful question that has been neglected in my self-reflection or personal growth process. This involves considering areas of my life that have not been recently scrutinized or evaluated, such as personal goals, relationships, career aspirations, or mental health. The goal is to pinpoint an overlooked aspect that could benefit from introspection or reevaluation to foster growth or improvement.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider shifting the focus from self-reflection to external influences. Instead of asking, \"What haven't I asked myself?\" reframe it to, \"What have others observed about me that I haven't considered?\" This perspective invites feedback from friends, family, or colleagues, potentially uncovering blind spots or areas for growth that may not have been apparent through personal introspection alone.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "With the recursive lens, consider what long-term patterns or recurring themes might be influencing the questions I neglect to ask myself. Are there specific areas of my life where avoidance or complacency tends to occur, leading to these overlooked inquiries? Additionally, what underlying beliefs or assumptions might be preventing me from engaging in deeper self-reflection, and how can I address these to foster more comprehensive personal growth?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I may have been neglecting to ask myself, \"What feedback have I received from others that I haven't fully explored or understood?\" The next step is to actively seek feedback from those close to me, reflecting on their insights to identify potential blind spots. This will involve setting aside dedicated time to consider how these observations align with or challenge my current self-perception and goals, thereby promoting a more holistic approach to personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about this trigger right now suggests a pattern of seeking self-improvement and continuous growth, possibly driven by a desire to avoid stagnation or to ensure alignment with personal values and goals. This approach often repeats a cycle of introspection and self-questioning, revealing a pattern of valuing self-awareness and adaptability. By stepping back, you can recognize this pattern and consider how it influences your decision-making and personal development strategies."
