  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about could be a specific issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront. This might be something related to personal relationships, career challenges, or a decision that requires significant change or effort. Identifying the exact nature of this problem is the first step toward addressing it, allowing me to develop a plan to tackle it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something overwhelming or uncomfortable, consider it as an opportunity for growth and learning. By reframing the problem as a chance to develop new skills or strengthen resilience, it can be approached with curiosity and openness rather than avoidance. This shift in perspective might reveal hidden benefits or insights that were not initially apparent.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, we can explore why this problem feels overwhelming or uncomfortable. What underlying fears or beliefs are contributing to the avoidance? Additionally, we might consider the broader patterns of avoidance in our life: Are there other areas where similar issues arise? Understanding these patterns may provide insights into the root causes and help develop strategies for addressing the problem more effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding likely stems from underlying fears or beliefs that make it feel overwhelming. The next step is to identify and articulate this specific problem and the emotions associated with it. I will take action by setting aside dedicated time to reflect on this issue, perhaps through journaling or discussing it with a trusted friend or counselor, to gain clarity and develop a plan to address it.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it represents a recurring pattern of avoidance when faced with challenging situations. This pattern might stem from a fear of failure or discomfort with uncertainty, which has previously led to procrastination or inaction. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously choose to break it by approaching the problem with a mindset focused on growth and learning, rather than evasion."
