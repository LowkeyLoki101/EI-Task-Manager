  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern that others might be missing, such as a consistent inefficiency in a process or a common error in data interpretation that leads to misunderstandings. This pattern could be impacting outcomes or productivity, and recognizing it could provide opportunities for improvement or innovation. By clearly identifying and articulating this pattern, I can help others become aware of it and work towards a solution.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the pattern you keep noticing might not be an inefficiency or error at all, but rather an unrecognized strength or opportunity. Perhaps others are missing how this pattern could be leveraged for a competitive advantage or used to improve team dynamics. By reframing the pattern as a potential asset rather than a problem, you might inspire innovative solutions or new strategies that capitalize on what initially seemed like a drawback.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What additional patterns might be connected to the one I've identified, and how do they interact to create the current situation? Are there underlying causes or systemic issues that contribute to the pattern, suggesting deeper organizational or structural changes are needed? Investigating these questions could uncover broader insights, prompting a more comprehensive analysis of the environment or systems involved, and potentially revealing new areas for improvement or innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring pattern I identified is an unrecognized asset that can be leveraged for strategic advantage. The next step is to conduct a workshop or brainstorming session with key stakeholders to explore this pattern further, encouraging them to view it as a potential opportunity rather than a problem. This collaborative approach will help generate innovative solutions and strategies that capitalize on this insight.",
  "generatedTasks": [

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this recurring pattern right now because it could significantly impact outcomes or productivity if left unaddressed. The pattern I often repeat in my approach is focusing on identifying inefficiencies or errors, which may stem from a problem-solving mindset aimed at improvement. However, this focus might also cause me to overlook potential strengths or opportunities that the pattern presents, suggesting a need for a more balanced perspective that considers both challenges and assets."
