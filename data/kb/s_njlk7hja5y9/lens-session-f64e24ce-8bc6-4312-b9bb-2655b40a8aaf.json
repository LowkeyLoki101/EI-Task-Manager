  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is finding a compelling story hook for marketing content that resonates with the current audience. I see the need to identify a narrative that captures attention and aligns with the brand's message while being relevant to today's cultural or market trends. This requires an understanding of the target audience's current interests and the broader context influencing their decisions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the story hook isn't about directly aligning with current trends but instead focuses on the timeless values and emotions that the brand embodies? By reframing the approach to highlight the brand's core mission or unique origin story, the content can create a deeper, more lasting connection with the audience. This perspective shifts the focus from chasing trends to building a narrative around authenticity and enduring values.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the timeless values and emotions that resonate across different demographics, and how can these be effectively woven into the brand's narrative? How do successful brands balance trend alignment with authenticity in their storytelling? This inquiry could lead to deeper research into case studies of brands that have successfully maintained relevance through authentic storytelling, as well as an examination of psychological studies on emotional resonance in marketing.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on the brand's core mission and timeless values such as authenticity, resilience, and innovation, we can create a story hook that resonates across diverse demographics. My next step is to research successful case studies of brands that have effectively leveraged these values in their storytelling. Additionally, I will explore psychological studies on emotional resonance to refine our approach, ensuring that the content not only aligns with the brand's identity but also emotionally engages the audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's an ongoing need to create marketing content that stands out and effectively engages the audience. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too much on aligning with fleeting trends instead of leveraging the brand's core values and unique story. By stepping back, I can see that a deeper connection might come from emphasizing authenticity and timeless narratives rather than constantly adapting to every new trend."
