  "topic": "Strategies for addressing avoidance behavior in business decision-making",
  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding revolves around a recurring pattern in my behavior, such as avoidance of confrontation. As a next step, I will pinpoint a specific situation that exemplifies this pattern and confront it directly, using it as a test case to practice new strategies for resolution. This action will help me break the habit of avoidance and potentially gain insights into handling similar issues more effectively in the future.",
