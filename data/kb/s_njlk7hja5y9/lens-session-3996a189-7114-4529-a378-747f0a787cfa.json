  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying and designing a simulation that can generate new, relevant data for our needs. The simulation should model a real-world scenario or process that is pertinent to our research or business objectives, ensuring the data produced is valuable and actionable. It requires understanding the parameters and variables that need to be included to accurately reflect the system being simulated.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating a new simulation, consider leveraging existing simulations and altering their parameters to explore new outcomes. This approach could reduce the time and resources needed to develop a simulation from scratch while still providing fresh insights. Additionally, collaborating with experts in the field who have experience with similar simulations might reveal overlooked opportunities for data generation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this trigger, we can explore questions such as: What existing simulations have been underutilized in our field that could be adapted for new insights? How can the outcomes from these simulations be validated against real-world data to ensure accuracy? Furthermore, investigating how advancements in technology, such as machine learning, could enhance the predictive capabilities of these simulations deserves deeper exploration.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying existing simulations that align with our objectives and adapting their parameters, we can efficiently generate new, valuable data. The next step is to conduct a review of available simulations within our field, consult with domain experts to assess their adaptability, and determine how machine learning could further refine these simulations. This approach will not only save resources but also enhance the reliability of the data generated.",
