  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a simulation that can generate new, relevant data for analysis or decision-making purposes. This involves determining the specific objectives of the simulation, such as understanding a certain phenomenon or testing a hypothesis, and selecting the appropriate model or system to simulate. Additionally, it's crucial to define the parameters and variables that will influence the simulation's outcomes to ensure the data generated is useful and applicable.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on what simulation to run, consider what specific gaps or questions exist in your current data set that need addressing. By identifying the missing pieces or the questions you wish to explore, you can better determine the type of simulation required. Additionally, think about utilizing unconventional methods, such as agent-based or stochastic simulations, which might offer new insights or reveal patterns not previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific variables or parameters are most uncertain or variable in your current model, and how might a simulation help clarify these uncertainties? Additionally, consider what new technologies or methodologies, such as machine learning-driven simulations or digital twins, could be explored to enhance the realism and accuracy of the data generated. Finally, what ethical considerations or potential biases should be addressed when designing and running these simulations to ensure the data is both valid and reliable?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that running an agent-based simulation could effectively address gaps related to individual behavioral patterns within the current data set. The next step is to identify the specific variables and parameters that have the most uncertainty and design the simulation to focus on these areas. Additionally, I will explore integrating machine learning techniques to enhance the simulation's predictive accuracy and ensure ethical considerations are factored into the design process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because generating new data through simulations can fill existing knowledge gaps and drive informed decision-making. The pattern I notice is a focus on traditional simulation methods, possibly overlooking innovative approaches that could yield more comprehensive insights. By questioning the underlying assumptions and exploring diverse simulation techniques, I can break this pattern and broaden the scope of potential data generation strategies."
