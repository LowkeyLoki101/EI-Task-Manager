  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves finding a way to integrate an emerging industry trend with simulation techniques to generate new and relevant data. I see an opportunity to leverage this trend as a variable or condition within the simulation model, allowing us to explore scenarios and outcomes that may not yet be evident in real-world data. By doing so, we can create data that anticipates future developments and informs strategic decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached this problem from the perspective of a collaborative innovation lab? Instead of viewing the industry trend as merely a variable in a simulation, we could treat it as a dynamic partner in a co-creation process. By engaging with stakeholders across different sectors and inviting them to contribute their insights and expertise, we can enhance the simulation with diverse perspectives, leading to more robust data generation and innovative solutions that are informed by real-world applicability and creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific industry trends currently hold potential for unexpected but impactful simulation applications, and how might they reshape traditional data modeling approaches? Additionally, how can collaborative innovation labs effectively balance diverse stakeholder inputs to ensure that simulations remain both grounded in current realities and forward-thinking? Exploring these questions could lead to the development of frameworks that integrate real-time trend analysis with adaptive simulation techniques, thereby enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying a current, impactful industry trend and integrating it into a simulation model as a dynamic, interactive element, we can generate fresh data that anticipates future scenarios. The next step is to select a specific trend and assemble a team of diverse stakeholders for a collaborative workshop to define the parameters of the simulation. This will ensure the simulation model is both innovative and grounded, allowing us to create actionable insights.",
