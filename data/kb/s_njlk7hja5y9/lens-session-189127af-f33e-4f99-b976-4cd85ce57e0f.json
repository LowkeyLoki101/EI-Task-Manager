  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore the unexpected pattern of solar technology's application in non-traditional sectors, such as agriculture or urban infrastructure, where its adoption is quietly transforming these industries. The problem lies in the fact that mainstream narratives typically focus on solar technology's role in energy production, overlooking its potential to innovate and disrupt other areas. By framing the story around these overlooked applications, I can highlight a unique and compelling angle that captures the transformative power of solar technology beyond its conventional uses.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I reframe the story to focus on the historical evolution and future potential of solar technology as a tool for social equity and empowerment? Instead of just highlighting its applications in non-traditional sectors, I could explore how solar technology is enabling underserved communities to leapfrog traditional energy infrastructures, fostering economic growth and environmental resilience. This angle would shift the narrative from technological innovation to societal impact, offering a fresh perspective on solar technology's broader role in shaping sustainable and inclusive futures.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the surprising pattern of solar technology in non-traditional sectors opens up several questions: How is solar technology specifically transforming these sectors, and what innovations are being developed as a result? What are the long-term societal and environmental impacts of these transformations? Additionally, investigating the role of policy and investment in accelerating solar technology adoption in underserved communities could provide insights into barriers and opportunities for wider application and empowerment. These questions merit deeper research to uncover untapped narratives and potential future developments in solar technology's application.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a story focused on the transformative impact of solar technology in non-traditional sectors, particularly its role in promoting social equity and empowerment. The next step is to conduct in-depth research into case studies where solar technology has successfully enabled underserved communities to bypass traditional energy structures, examining both the challenges and successes. This research will inform a compelling narrative that not only highlights technological innovation but also underscores the societal benefits and potential for sustainable development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm drawn to uncovering narratives that challenge conventional perspectives and highlight the intersections between technology and societal impact. The pattern I'm repeating in my approach is focusing on the potential for underexplored technologies to drive transformative change in unexpected areas. By consistently seeking out these unique angles, I aim to engage audiences with stories that not only inform but also inspire shifts in understanding and action."
