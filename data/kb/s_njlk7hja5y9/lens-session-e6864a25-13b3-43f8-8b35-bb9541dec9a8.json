  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new and relevant data for our needs. We need to consider the type of data required, the context in which it will be used, and the parameters that need to be simulated. This involves selecting or designing a simulation model that can accurately mimic real-world processes or scenarios to produce useful data outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through simulations, consider reframing the challenge by exploring existing datasets that might be underutilized or overlooked. What if we could combine or analyze these existing datasets in innovative ways to extract new insights? This approach might provide a more efficient path to generating valuable data outcomes without the need to design a complex simulation from scratch.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of recursive exploration, we could delve deeper into identifying specific variables and parameters that most significantly impact the outcomes of the desired simulation. What are the critical assumptions underlying these simulations, and how might altering them provide new insights? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate how emerging technologies, such as machine learning and AI, could enhance the accuracy and efficiency of simulation models in generating new data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by leveraging existing datasets and combining them innovatively, we can extract valuable insights without needing to design a complex simulation from scratch. The next step is to conduct a thorough review of available datasets relevant to our context and experiment with combining them using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to uncover new patterns. This approach will guide us in determining if a new simulation is necessary or if existing data can fulfill our objectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there is a need to generate new insights or data to address a specific problem or to fill a gap in our current understanding. This pattern of seeking simulations might reflect a tendency to rely on creating new inputs rather than fully exploring and leveraging existing resources. By recognizing this, I can shift focus towards maximizing the utility of available data and potentially uncovering valuable insights without the need for extensive simulation efforts."
