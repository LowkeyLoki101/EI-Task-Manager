  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the assumptions underlying my current beliefs or decisions. The focus is on identifying any potential inaccuracies or biases in these assumptions that could lead to incorrect conclusions or actions. It's about uncovering hidden or unexamined beliefs that might not hold true.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the assumption as a potential opportunity for exploration rather than a potential error. Instead of focusing on what might be wrong, think of it as a chance to discover new insights or alternative approaches that could enhance your understanding or strategy. This shift in perspective encourages a curious and open-minded attitude, leading to growth and innovation rather than just error correction.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the assumption further, consider what underlying beliefs or values influence this assumption and whether they have been shaped by cultural, societal, or personal experiences that warrant deeper examination. Additionally, question whether this assumption might lead to other interconnected assumptions that could similarly benefit from scrutiny. Investigating these layers could reveal a network of beliefs that, when reconsidered, might offer innovative solutions or new perspectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by viewing assumptions as opportunities for exploration, I can uncover new insights and alternative strategies that improve my decision-making. The next actionable step is to actively identify one key assumption in a current project and systematically explore its origins, impacts, and interconnected beliefs. This will help me refine my approach and ensure it is grounded in well-examined, more robust assumptions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because challenging assumptions is a crucial step in ensuring my decisions and beliefs are well-founded and adaptable. The pattern I might be repeating is a tendency to focus on identifying errors or flaws, rather than leveraging these assumptions as opportunities to explore new perspectives and insights. By adopting a meta-lens, I can shift towards a mindset that values curiosity and growth, turning potential errors into pathways for learning and innovation."
