As a next step, I'll allocate time to reflect on recent life changes, perhaps using journaling or a mind map, to identify these areas and formulate specific questions that could lead to deeper understanding and growth. This will help ensure I'm continually addressing both overlooked and unexplored aspects of my life.",
