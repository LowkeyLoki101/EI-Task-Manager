  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the patterns I notice are overlooked due to common cognitive biases or lack of data interpretation skills among others. The next step is to develop a structured approach to communicate these patterns effectively, possibly through visual aids or interactive workshops, to highlight their significance and educate others on recognizing similar patterns in the future. Additionally, I'll explore tools or methodologies that can enhance my pattern detection and articulation skills.",
