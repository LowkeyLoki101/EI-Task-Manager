  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that a hybrid simulation approach, combining existing data with new variables through methodologies like agent-based modeling or Monte Carlo simulations, could effectively address gaps in our current data. The next step is to identify specific variables and scenarios that are underrepresented in our current data set and select the appropriate simulation tools to integrate these new elements. I will also evaluate the ethical and practical implications to ensure that the simulated data is valid and reliable for decision-making.",
