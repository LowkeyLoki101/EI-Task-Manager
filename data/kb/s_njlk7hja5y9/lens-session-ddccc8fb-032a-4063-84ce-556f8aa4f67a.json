  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify a simulation model that can generate new, relevant data for a specific purpose or study. The problem involves determining the type of data required, the variables involved, and the context in which the simulation will be run to ensure the data produced is useful and accurate. This requires selecting an appropriate simulation type—such as a Monte Carlo simulation, agent-based model, or system dynamics approach—based on the goals and the complexity of the system being studied.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through simulations, consider the possibility of enhancing existing datasets by integrating them with simulation-generated data. This perspective emphasizes the value of hybrid approaches that combine empirical data with simulated insights to enrich analysis and decision-making. By reframing the question, the emphasis shifts to identifying gaps in current data and using simulations to fill these gaps, enhancing the overall robustness and applicability of the dataset.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring further, consider what specific variables or parameters are most critical to the simulation's success and accuracy. What assumptions underlie these simulations, and how might altering these assumptions impact the data generated? Additionally, investigate the potential biases that could be introduced through the chosen simulation model and explore methodologies to mitigate them. How can the insights from this simulation be validated against real-world data to ensure reliability?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to run a Monte Carlo simulation focused on the most critical variables identified in our analysis, ensuring to incorporate real-world data to validate the outcomes. The next step is to gather and analyze existing datasets to determine where gaps exist, then design the simulation to address these gaps, while keeping in mind potential biases and assumptions. This approach will enhance our dataset with both empirical and simulated data, increasing its robustness for decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about running a simulation to create new data because there's a recurring pattern of seeking innovative solutions to data limitations, aiming to enhance decision-making processes. This approach reflects a broader tendency to rely on technological and analytical tools to overcome gaps in existing information. By recognizing this pattern, I can ensure that the motivation behind running a simulation aligns with strategic objectives and truly addresses the identified needs, rather than defaulting to simulations as a habitual solution."
