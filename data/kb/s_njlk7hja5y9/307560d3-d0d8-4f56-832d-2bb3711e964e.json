  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by exploring existing validated simulations and collaborating with external partners, we can efficiently generate new and credible data tailored to our specific needs. The next step is to conduct a thorough review of available simulation platforms and reach out to potential collaborators to discuss adaptation and integration possibilities. Additionally, I will identify key parameters and variables that align with our objectives to ensure the simulation's relevance and accuracy.",
