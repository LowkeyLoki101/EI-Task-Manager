  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that will capture the audience's attention and resonate with their current interests or needs. I see the need to align this hook with current trends, audience preferences, and the unique value proposition of the product or service being marketed. The goal is to craft a narrative that is timely, engaging, and relevant to the target audience.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a story hook based on trends and audience preferences, consider reframing the approach by asking, \"What unique perspective or untold story about my product or service can I share that challenges conventional thinking?\" By exploring what makes your offering distinct and how it can disrupt the status quo, you can create a story hook that not only captures attention but also sparks curiosity and conversation. This angle encourages innovation and differentiation, potentially leading to a more memorable and impactful marketing narrative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What unique aspects of my product or service have not been highlighted in previous marketing efforts, and how can these elements be tied into current cultural or industry shifts? Additionally, how can I involve my audience in the storytelling process, perhaps through user-generated content or interactive campaigns, to deepen engagement and authenticity? Exploring these questions can lead to innovative content strategies that resonate more deeply with the audience.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to craft a marketing story that highlights a unique, untold aspect of my product or service, linking it to a current cultural or industry trend. My next step is to brainstorm these unique elements and identify a trend that aligns with them. Then, I will develop an interactive campaign that encourages user-generated content, allowing the audience to participate in the storytelling process, thus enhancing engagement and authenticity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I often default to focusing on external trends and audience preferences when creating marketing content, which might limit my creativity and originality. This pattern reflects a tendency to prioritize what's currently popular over what is genuinely unique or innovative about my product or service. By stepping back, I can recognize the opportunity to shift my approach to highlight distinctive narratives that challenge the norm, fostering a deeper connection with my audience."
