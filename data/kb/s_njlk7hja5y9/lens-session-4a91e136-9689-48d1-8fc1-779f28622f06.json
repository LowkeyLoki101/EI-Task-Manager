  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying potentially incorrect assumptions that might be influencing my decisions or perceptions. I need to clearly identify the assumption in question and examine the basis on which it was formed to determine if it is grounded in facts or if it might be based on outdated or incomplete information.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a potentially incorrect assumption, consider what opportunities might arise from questioning all assumptions, correct or incorrect. By adopting a mindset of curiosity and openness, you can explore new perspectives and uncover innovative solutions that might have been overlooked. This approach shifts the focus from merely correcting errors to fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By questioning the assumption of potentially being wrong, we can delve into the broader implications of how assumptions shape our beliefs and actions. What other assumptions are underlying my approach to this problem, and how might they be interconnected? Additionally, how can systematically challenging assumptions lead to a deeper understanding of the systemic biases in my thinking, and what methods can be implemented to ensure that this reflective practice becomes a regular part of my decision-making process?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by regularly challenging my assumptions—both correct and incorrect—I can foster a more adaptive and innovative mindset. The next step is to implement a systematic practice of reflection, such as scheduling weekly sessions to review and question my assumptions and their impacts on my decisions. This will help ensure continuous learning and adaptation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions right now because I am likely seeking to improve my decision-making processes by ensuring they are based on accurate and current information. A recurring pattern in my approach may be an overemphasis on correcting errors instead of fostering an environment where questioning all assumptions, whether right or wrong, is encouraged to promote growth and innovation. By shifting towards a broader mindset of curiosity, I can enhance my adaptability and openness to new opportunities."
