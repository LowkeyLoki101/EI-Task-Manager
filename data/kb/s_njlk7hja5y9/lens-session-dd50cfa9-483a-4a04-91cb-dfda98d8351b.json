  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue in my personal or professional life that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront. It could relate to a decision I need to make, a relationship that requires attention, or a task that I've been procrastinating on. Clearly identifying this issue can help in addressing it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't as daunting as it seems, and it's actually an opportunity for growth or improvement? By reframing the issue as a potential catalyst for positive change, I might find new motivation to address it. Instead of seeing it as something overwhelming, I can view it as a chance to learn and develop new skills or strengthen relationships.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the problem I'm avoiding could lead to questions such as: What specific fears or beliefs are preventing me from addressing this issue? How might my avoidance behavior be impacting other areas of my life, and what are the long-term consequences of not confronting this problem? Investigating these questions could uncover deeper, underlying issues that deserve exploration and may reveal patterns or habits that need to be addressed for overall personal growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is a task or decision that feels overwhelming, but by reframing it as an opportunity for growth, I can approach it more positively. My next step is to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and set a specific time to address the first part, which will make the issue seem less daunting and more actionable. This approach will help me build momentum and gradually tackle the problem while learning and growing from the experience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem because avoiding it is likely a pattern of procrastination or fear of discomfort that I've encountered before in similar situations. This pattern often involves focusing on short-term relief instead of long-term resolution. By recognizing this tendency, I can consciously choose to break the cycle and approach the problem with a more solution-oriented mindset, potentially reframing it as a learning opportunity."
