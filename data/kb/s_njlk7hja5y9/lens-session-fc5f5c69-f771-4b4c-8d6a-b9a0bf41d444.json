  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a useful simulation that can generate new and relevant data for our needs. I see an opportunity to create a virtual environment or scenario that mimics real-world processes or outcomes, allowing us to test hypotheses and gather insights. This involves determining the specific objectives of the simulation and the type of data required to achieve those objectives.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating a new simulation, consider collaborating with external partners or utilizing existing simulations that have been validated and can be adapted to your needs. This shift in perspective allows for leveraging already available resources and expertise, potentially saving time and offering new insights by integrating different datasets or methodologies. Additionally, exploring open-source simulation platforms could provide a flexible foundation to customize and expand upon existing models.",

  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific parameters and variables that will most accurately reflect the real-world scenario we wish to simulate, and how can we ensure the credibility of the data generated? Additionally, could our exploration into existing simulations uncover gaps or opportunities for innovation that others have not yet addressed, potentially leading to the development of a novel simulation model that contributes unique insights to our field?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by exploring existing validated simulations and collaborating with external partners, we can efficiently generate new and credible data tailored to our specific needs. The next step is to conduct a thorough review of available simulation platforms and reach out to potential collaborators to discuss adaptation and integration possibilities. Additionally, I will identify key parameters and variables that align with our objectives to ensure the simulation's relevance and accuracy.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about running a simulation to generate new data because there is a consistent pattern of seeking innovative ways to gather insights and test hypotheses. This approach often stems from a desire to explore untapped opportunities and enhance decision-making through data-driven strategies. Recognizing this pattern can help ensure these efforts are not only novel but also practical and aligned with existing resources and collaborations."
