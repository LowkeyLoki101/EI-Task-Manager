  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by integrating prompts from different disciplines and cultural perspectives and potentially using technology to identify patterns, I can generate more innovative and diverse ideas than by simply shuffling my own prompts. As a next step, I will experiment with mixing prompts from varied sources and employing a basic algorithm to analyze and group them by emerging themes. This approach will help identify unique connections and insights that could lead to creative breakthroughs.",
