  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem-solving approach that involves starting from the desired outcome and working in reverse to identify the steps needed to achieve it. This backward approach allows for a clear understanding of the necessary components and actions required at each stage, potentially revealing overlooked aspects or alternative strategies. By framing the problem this way, I can systematically trace the path from the solution back to the initial conditions, ensuring all critical elements are addressed.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from another angle, consider what would happen if you approached the problem not just backwards, but also from a lateral perspective. Instead of solely focusing on reverse-engineering from the desired outcome, think about examining parallel problems or solutions in different contexts that might offer insights or innovative approaches. This could reveal unexpected connections or strategies that are not immediately evident when looking at the problem linearly or even in reverse.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively applying the approach of working backwards, we can delve deeper into each step identified in reverse-engineering the problem. This involves questioning the necessity and effectiveness of each step, asking what alternative paths could achieve the same outcome, and exploring if any steps can be combined or eliminated. Additionally, we can investigate other domains where backward approaches have been successful, analyzing their methods to uncover new strategies or insights that could potentially enhance our current problem-solving process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by applying a backward approach, combined with lateral thinking and recursive questioning, I can uncover more efficient or innovative solutions to the problem. The next step is to map out the desired outcome in detail, then systematically work backwards through each stage, incorporating insights from analogous problems in other contexts. I will document any alternative strategies or connections discovered during this process to refine and optimize the original plan.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I am seeking a method to ensure that all critical components are addressed and to uncover any overlooked aspects. This pattern of reverse engineering is something I often use to gain clarity and assurance in problem-solving, as it allows me to validate each step against the desired outcome. By identifying this pattern, I can also explore whether this approach limits my perspective, and consider integrating additional strategies, such as lateral thinking, to enhance my problem-solving toolkit."
