  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is determining the type of simulation that can be executed to generate new data. This involves identifying the objectives of the simulation, the type of data needed, and the resources available to create and run the simulation effectively. By clearly defining these parameters, we can tailor a simulation to produce the most relevant and useful data for our needs.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through a simulation, consider what existing data sources or simulations could be combined or modified to provide fresh insights. By leveraging and adapting current data sets or models, you might find a more efficient path to generating the information you need without starting from scratch. Additionally, exploring collaborations with others who have different data sets or simulation models could open up new avenues for innovation and data generation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific data gaps or unanswered questions that could be addressed by a new simulation? Additionally, what existing simulation models or techniques could be adapted to provide insights into these questions? Exploring these queries could lead to a deeper understanding of the most effective simulation approach and the potential to innovate existing methods for data generation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying specific data gaps and questions, we can tailor an existing simulation model to address these needs. The next step is to conduct a review of current simulation models and data sources to determine which can be adapted or combined to fill our data gaps. Additionally, considering collaboration with other experts in the field could provide access to different models or datasets that complement our objectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering running a simulation to create new data because there is a need for fresh insights that existing data does not currently provide. This reflects a pattern of seeking innovation through novel data generation rather than optimizing or utilizing existing resources. By questioning this approach, I can ensure that the solution aligns with broader goals, such as efficiency and collaboration, and consider alternative methods that might yield the desired insights without necessarily starting from scratch."
