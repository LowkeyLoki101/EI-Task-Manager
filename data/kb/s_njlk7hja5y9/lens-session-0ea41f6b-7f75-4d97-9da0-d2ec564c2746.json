  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem of avoidance, where there may be an underlying issue or decision that I am not confronting directly. This could be due to fear of the potential outcomes, lack of clarity on the issue itself, or feeling overwhelmed by the complexity or consequences of addressing it. By framing this problem, I acknowledge the need to identify what specifically I am avoiding and why, in order to move towards a resolution.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, avoidance might not solely be a problem but a protective mechanism. Perhaps the issue I am avoiding is not yet ripe for resolution, and my subconscious is buying time for further information or readiness to emerge. Instead of forcing confrontation, I could explore what this avoidance is protecting me from or what conditions would make addressing the issue feel safer or more manageable.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By delving deeper, I can ask myself what specific emotions or beliefs are tied to the avoidance of this problem. Are there past experiences influencing my current hesitation? Additionally, what small steps can I take to gather more information or build up my confidence to eventually confront the issue? Exploring these questions may reveal underlying patterns or fears that warrant further investigation, helping to discern whether the avoidance is temporary or indicative of a deeper issue needing attention.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the avoidance stems from a fear of uncertainty and potential negative outcomes. As a next step, I will identify one specific aspect of the problem that feels most manageable and gather information or resources that could help me address it. By taking this small, actionable step, I aim to build confidence and reduce the fear associated with tackling the larger issue.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because there is a recurring pattern in my approach where I tend to sidestep confronting issues that provoke discomfort or uncertainty. This avoidance pattern might be a habitual way of protecting myself from perceived threats or complexities. Recognizing this pattern allows me to consciously decide whether to continue avoiding or to create conditions that make addressing the issue feel less daunting."
