  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is determining which type of simulation can be constructed to generate new data that is valuable and relevant to our objectives. This involves identifying the specific parameters and variables that need to be modeled and ensuring the simulation aligns with the goals of data collection, whether for predicting outcomes, testing hypotheses, or understanding complex systems.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on constructing a simulation from scratch, consider leveraging existing simulation frameworks or models that can be adapted or expanded to meet our data needs. Alternatively, explore the possibility of using a hybrid approach by combining real-world data with simulated inputs to enhance the robustness and applicability of the new data generated. This reframed perspective opens up opportunities to save time and resources while still achieving our objectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Considering the recursive lens, we could delve deeper into the types of simulations that align with our objectives by exploring questions such as: What existing models in our field can be adapted to our needs? How do different simulation techniques (e.g., agent-based, Monte Carlo, system dynamics) compare in their ability to generate relevant data? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate how integrating machine learning with simulations could enhance data accuracy and predictive capabilities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a hybrid simulation approach, combining elements of existing models with real-world data inputs, will be most effective in generating the new data we need. The next step is to conduct a review of current simulation frameworks relevant to our field, evaluate their adaptability, and identify opportunities to integrate machine learning for enhanced data generation. I will compile a list of potential simulation techniques and consult with stakeholders to prioritize those that align best with our objectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about running a simulation to create new data because there is a need to either fill a gap in existing data or to test scenarios that are difficult to observe in real life. This approach might repeat a pattern of seeking innovative solutions to gather insights, emphasizing a proactive stance on data acquisition. By stepping back, I can assess whether this habit of generating new data through simulations is always the best approach or if there are other unexplored avenues that could yield equally valuable insights with less complexity."
