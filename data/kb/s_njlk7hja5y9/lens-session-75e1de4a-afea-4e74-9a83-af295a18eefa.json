  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about a problem that is likely causing discomfort or anxiety, potentially due to its complexity, emotional weight, or perceived lack of immediate solutions. This avoidance might stem from a fear of the consequences or from feeling overwhelmed by the potential effort required to address it. Identifying this problem clearly is the first step toward understanding and eventually resolving it.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, what if the problem you're avoiding isn't necessarily negative? Consider it as an opportunity for growth or a chance to innovate. Instead of viewing it as an overwhelming challenge, see it as a puzzle or a project that could lead to personal development or a breakthrough. This shift in perspective might reduce the anxiety associated with the problem and inspire a more proactive approach to tackling it.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific aspects of this problem are causing the most anxiety or discomfort, and why? Could breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts make it easier to approach and understand? Additionally, what resources, support, or knowledge might be necessary to address this problem effectively, and how can I begin acquiring them?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a complex or emotionally challenging situation that feels overwhelming. The next step is to break it down into smaller, manageable parts and identify one specific aspect to tackle first. I'll also list resources or support I might need and set a timeline to start addressing this issue, turning it into a structured plan for resolution.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because I recognize a pattern of avoidance when faced with challenges that evoke discomfort or anxiety. This avoidance might be a recurring defense mechanism to protect myself from stress or failure, but it's also preventing me from addressing important issues effectively. By identifying this pattern, I can consciously choose to face these challenges with a more constructive mindset, using them as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles to be ignored."
