  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by focusing on identifying and evaluating the most critical assumptions impacting my desired outcomes, I can better prioritize my efforts and uncover both errors and opportunities for improvement. The next step is to list my key assumptions related to a specific decision or project, rank them by their potential impact, and then critically assess their validity and implications. This approach will guide my actions towards more informed and strategic decision-making.",
