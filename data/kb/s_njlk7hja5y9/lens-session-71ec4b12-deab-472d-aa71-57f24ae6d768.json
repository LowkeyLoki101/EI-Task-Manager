  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a personal or introspective question that I have neglected to consider recently. I see an opportunity to uncover areas of my life or mindset that need reflection or reassessment. This involves examining aspects of personal growth, relationships, or career that may have been overlooked in my routine evaluations.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on questions I haven't asked myself, I could reframe this to consider the assumptions I've been making without question. By identifying and challenging these underlying assumptions, I might uncover blind spots in my thinking or areas of my life that need attention. This shift in perspective encourages me to not just ask new questions, but to critically evaluate the foundations of my current beliefs and decisions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying assumptions that have guided my recent decisions, and how might they need reevaluation? Additionally, are there areas of my life where I have become complacent, assuming they are fine without deeper reflection? These questions prompt deeper investigation into habitual thought patterns and the potential need for change or growth in areas I've taken for granted.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging the underlying assumptions guiding my recent decisions, I can uncover areas where I might have been complacent or overlooked potential for growth. The next step is to set aside time to consciously reflect on these assumptions, perhaps through journaling or discussing with a trusted friend, to evaluate their validity and explore new perspectives. This will help me identify specific areas in my life that require deeper introspection or change.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I have a tendency to focus on routine evaluations and might be missing opportunities for deeper introspection. This pattern suggests that I might often overlook the importance of questioning the assumptions underlying my daily decisions. By applying a meta-lens, I can recognize this habit and consciously aim to disrupt it, creating space for more meaningful self-reflection and growth."
