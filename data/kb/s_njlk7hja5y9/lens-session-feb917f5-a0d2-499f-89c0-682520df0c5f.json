  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a meaningful question that I haven't considered recently, which could provide new insights or perspectives on my current life situation. I see the need to explore areas of my life, such as personal growth, relationships, or career, where I might have settled into routine thinking and could benefit from fresh introspection. The goal is to uncover a question that challenges my current assumptions or uncovers neglected areas of self-reflection.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this from the perspective of a child who's constantly curious and questioning? Instead of focusing on finding a profound or overlooked question, I could embrace a mindset of playful curiosity, asking whatever comes to mind without judgment. This shift might lead me to explore questions I would normally dismiss, encouraging a more spontaneous and open-ended journey of self-discovery.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the trigger with a recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: \"What specific areas of my life feel stagnant and could benefit from a fresh perspective?\" or \"How might my current routines or beliefs be limiting my growth?\" Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the methodology of questioning itself, asking \"What techniques can I use to regularly introduce new questions into my life to stimulate growth and prevent complacency?\" These inquiries not only delve deeper into the original question but also prompt ongoing self-reflection and exploration.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that adopting a mindset of playful curiosity will lead me to explore new and potentially insightful questions about my life. As a next step, I will set aside time each week to engage in a playful questioning exercise, where I allow myself to ask any and all questions that come to mind, without judgment. This will help me uncover areas of my life that might be overlooked or stagnant, fostering continuous personal growth and self-discovery.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I recognize the value of introspection and the potential for growth that comes from asking new questions. This pattern of seeking out fresh questions reflects a desire to break free from routine thinking and to challenge my current perspectives. By using a meta-lens, I'm aiming to understand the underlying motivations and habitual thought patterns that guide my introspective practices, ensuring they remain dynamic and not stagnant."
