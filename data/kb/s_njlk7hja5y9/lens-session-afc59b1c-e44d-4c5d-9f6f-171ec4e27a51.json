  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential of generating new and possibly innovative prompts by randomizing the order or combination of existing ones. This involves analyzing whether such a shuffle could lead to fresh insights, stimulate creativity, or uncover overlooked connections between ideas. The goal is to determine the value and effectiveness of this method in creating novel content or perspectives.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the randomness of shuffling prompts, I considered it as a method to intentionally disrupt my usual thought patterns? By seeing shuffling as a tool for breaking habitual thinking, I might discover new perspectives not by chance, but by deliberately challenging the conventional flow of ideas. This approach could lead to more deliberate innovation rather than accidental creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should I use to evaluate the effectiveness of newly emerged prompts in sparking creativity or providing valuable insights? Additionally, how might the practice of shuffling prompts be adapted or refined to better suit different contexts or fields, such as education, problem-solving, or artistic endeavors? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of how to harness randomness and disruption as tools for innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can serve as an intentional strategy to disrupt habitual thought patterns, potentially leading to innovative ideas and solutions. As a next step, I will test this hypothesis by selecting a set of existing prompts, shuffling them, and evaluating the outcomes using predefined criteria for creativity and insight. Based on the results, I will refine the shuffling method to better suit specific contexts, such as creative writing or problem-solving sessions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking ways to enhance creativity and innovation in my thought processes. This approach reveals a pattern of relying on external randomness to break free from established thinking habits. By recognizing this, I can more consciously incorporate structured disruptions into my routine, aiming for intentional shifts in perspective rather than leaving it to chance."
