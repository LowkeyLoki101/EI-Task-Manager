  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a simulation that can generate new data relevant to our needs. The simulation should be designed to model scenarios or systems pertinent to our objectives, allowing us to explore outcomes and gather insights that are not easily obtainable through real-world experiments or existing data sources.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through a simulation, consider the simulation as a tool for hypothesis testing. What if you used it to validate existing models or theories, thereby enhancing their reliability and applicability? By reframing the simulation as a means to test and refine current understanding, you can generate data that not only fills gaps but also strengthens existing frameworks.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific variables or parameters within the simulation that could yield the most insightful data? Additionally, how might different simulation models or algorithms affect the outcomes, and which modeling approach best aligns with our objectives? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of the simulation's design, as well as the potential need for iterative testing and refinement of the model to ensure it accurately reflects the complexities of the real-world system being studied.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by designing a simulation focused on testing specific hypotheses related to our objectives, we can generate valuable data that enhances our understanding of the system in question. The next step is to identify the key variables and select a modeling approach that aligns with our goals. I will begin by reviewing existing models and theories to determine which aspects require validation or refinement through simulation, then proceed to develop a prototype model for initial testing.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about running a simulation to create new data because there is a need to explore possibilities and understand systems beyond what current data allows. This reflects a pattern of seeking innovative ways to fill knowledge gaps by leveraging computational tools. By using simulations, I aim to extend beyond the limitations of existing data and experiments, which suggests a recurring approach of using technology to enhance and validate theoretical frameworks."
