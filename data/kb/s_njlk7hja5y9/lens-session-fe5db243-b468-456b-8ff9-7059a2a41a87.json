  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "I see a scenario where I unexpectedly uncover information or an object that is completely contrary to my current understanding or expectations. This surprise would stem from its nature being unusual, hidden, or previously considered improbable. The key here is identifying what assumptions or blind spots I have that could lead to such a surprising discovery.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the surprise not as an unexpected discovery but as a revelation about your own preconceived notions and biases. Instead of focusing on the external surprise, reflect on how finding something unexpected might illuminate your internal assumptions and beliefs. This approach shifts the emphasis from the surprise itself to the underlying reasons why it was surprising, allowing for a deeper understanding of your thought processes and potential blind spots.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What assumptions am I currently holding that, if proven wrong, would lead to surprise? How might actively seeking out information that challenges these assumptions provide a deeper understanding of my thought patterns and biases? Additionally, what methods or tools can I employ to regularly audit my beliefs and expectations to preemptively uncover potential surprises?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from unexamined assumptions or biases. To address this, I will actively seek out perspectives and information that challenge my current beliefs. As a next step, I will set a regular schedule to review and question my assumptions, perhaps through journaling or discussions with individuals who hold different viewpoints, to preemptively uncover and understand potential surprises.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because surprises often reveal hidden aspects of my perceptions and assumptions that I may not be aware of. By focusing on what would surprise me, I'm engaging in a pattern of self-discovery, seeking to uncover blind spots and biases that shape my understanding of the world. This process is crucial for personal growth and developing a more nuanced perspective."
