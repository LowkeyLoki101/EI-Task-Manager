  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring the potential for creativity and innovation by rearranging existing prompts or ideas. By shuffling your own prompts, you aim to uncover new perspectives, combinations, or insights that may not have been apparent initially. This approach seeks to break out of existing patterns and inspire fresh thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from a different perspective, consider the act of shuffling your prompts as a metaphor for embracing uncertainty and surrendering control. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome of new ideas, view this process as an exercise in letting go of preconceived notions and allowing randomness to guide innovation. This perspective shifts the emphasis from seeking specific new insights to exploring the freedom and potential growth that comes with unpredictability.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "When applying the recursive lens, consider what specific patterns or themes emerge when prompts are shuffled multiple times, and how these patterns influence the creative process. What are the underlying principles or cognitive biases that might be revealed through such an exercise? Further investigation could explore how randomness affects idea generation across different domains, or how this method could be structured to maximize creative output while minimizing cognitive overload.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, I can uncover novel connections and ideas that may lead to innovative solutions or perspectives. The next step is to actively engage in this exercise by randomly rearranging existing prompts and documenting any emergent themes or insights. This will help me understand how randomness influences creativity and identify any recurring patterns that could inform future creative processes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about shuffling your prompts, you are engaging in a pattern of seeking novelty and disruption to escape the confines of routine thinking. This approach mirrors a broader pattern of desiring control over creativity while simultaneously yearning for spontaneous inspiration. Recognizing this duality can help you consciously balance structure with openness, allowing both intentional design and serendipitous discovery to coexist in your creative process."
