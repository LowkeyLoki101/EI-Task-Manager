  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is the potential presence of an incorrect assumption influencing my understanding or decision-making. I need to identify and challenge any assumptions that may not be accurate or based on outdated or incomplete information. This will help ensure that my conclusions or actions are based on a correct and comprehensive understanding of the situation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the possibility of an incorrect assumption, consider the assumption as an opportunity for growth and learning. What if the assumption, whether right or wrong, serves as a stepping stone to explore deeper insights or innovative solutions? By viewing assumptions as hypotheses to test rather than obstacles to eliminate, you can foster a mindset that encourages curiosity and adaptability in your decision-making process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions arise such as: \"What underlying assumptions led to the formation of the current assumption?\" and \"How do these layers of assumptions interact to shape my perception?\" This warrants deeper investigation into the origins and influences of these assumptions, potentially involving research into historical data, expert opinions, or psychological biases that might be affecting my thought process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the assumption in question may be rooted in outdated information or cognitive biases that have not been critically examined. The next step is to conduct a thorough review of the current data and seek diverse perspectives to validate or refute the assumption. I will also document these findings to refine my understanding and decision-making process moving forward.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about the potential for incorrect assumptions because I want to ensure my decisions are based on accurate and comprehensive information, rather than on potentially flawed beliefs. This pattern indicates a tendency to prioritize precision and correctness, which can sometimes lead to over-analysis or hesitation. By recognizing this, I can balance my approach to include more intuitive and exploratory thinking, allowing for both accuracy and creativity in problem-solving."
