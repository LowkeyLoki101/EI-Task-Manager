  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement in processes are overlooked by others, possibly due to familiarity or ingrained habits. This could relate to how tasks are approached or how information is managed, suggesting a need for a fresh perspective or innovative solutions. Identifying and addressing these overlooked patterns could lead to significant improvements in productivity or effectiveness.",
  "reframeStep": "What if this pattern isn't just about overlooked inefficiencies but also about a deeper resistance to change or fear of disrupting the status quo among colleagues? Instead of focusing solely on the inefficiencies, consider exploring the underlying reasons why these patterns persist, such as organizational culture or individual apprehensions. By addressing these root causes, you may not only identify opportunities for improvement but also foster a more open environment for innovation and change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "The pattern of overlooked inefficiencies could lead to questions about the specific processes or habits that consistently go unnoticed and why they remain under the radar. This opens up avenues for deeper investigation into how organizational culture or cognitive biases contribute to these blind spots. Furthermore, it raises the question of what specific strategies or tools could be developed to better identify and address these inefficiencies, and how fostering a culture of continuous improvement and openness to change might mitigate the persistence of these patterns.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the persistent pattern of overlooked inefficiencies is deeply tied to organizational culture and individual resistance to change. As a next step, I plan to conduct a survey or hold focus group discussions to gather insights into employees' perceptions of change and innovation within the organization. This will help identify specific cultural or cognitive barriers and inform strategies to create a more open environment for improvement and innovation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because it highlights a recurring challenge in my environment that others might not notice, due to their proximity to the issue or a reluctance to question established norms. This approach often reflects a pattern of seeking out blind spots and areas of improvement, driven by a desire to enhance processes and encourage growth. It's important to recognize if this inclination is part of a broader tendency to focus on process optimization and whether it might also be useful to consider the human and cultural aspects that perpetuate these patterns."
