  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential creativity and innovation that could arise from rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling prompts, you may discover unique combinations and perspectives that weren't immediately obvious, leading to fresh insights or solutions. This approach encourages breaking free from conventional patterns of thinking to unlock new possibilities.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from the perspective of a musician composing a new piece, shuffling prompts could be likened to improvising with different musical notes and rhythms. This process might lead to unexpected harmonies and melodies, sparking creativity in ways that static compositions cannot. Alternatively, from a data analyst's viewpoint, shuffling prompts might resemble data permutation, offering new patterns and correlations that could drive innovative solutions or insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Shuffling your prompts could lead to questions about how randomness and chance can influence creativity and problem-solving. It raises inquiries into whether there are optimal ways to shuffle prompts to maximize innovation or if certain combinations consistently yield more insightful results. Additionally, it could be valuable to investigate how different fields, such as art, science, or technology, utilize randomness to foster discovery and whether these methods can be adapted or improved.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to novel insights and creative breakthroughs by generating unexpected combinations. As a next step, I will experiment with randomly rearranging my current set of prompts and document any new questions or ideas that emerge. This exercise will help identify patterns or themes that consistently lead to innovative thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, I am exploring why I am drawn to the idea of shuffling prompts. This reflects a pattern of seeking novel perspectives and a desire to break free from routine thinking. It suggests a tendency to challenge existing mental frameworks, aiming for creativity and innovation by disrupting conventional thought processes. Understanding this pattern can help refine my approach to problem-solving, ensuring it remains dynamic and adaptable."
