  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by identifying specific gaps in our current data, I can design a simulation that strategically fills those gaps to support our decision-making processes. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of existing datasets to pinpoint these gaps and define the specific variables and scenarios that the simulation should address. This will ensure that the data generated is both relevant and actionable.",
