  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea framed here is identifying unexpected discoveries or realizations that could challenge or shift my current understanding or assumptions. I see the need to pinpoint specific areas or topics where surprises are most likely to occur, which could lead to new insights or opportunities for growth. This involves being open to exploring unknowns and considering perspectives or information that I may have previously overlooked.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from the angle of active exploration, rather than passive discovery, shifts the focus to what I can intentionally seek out that might surprise me. Instead of waiting for surprises to occur, I could identify areas where I have strong assumptions and actively investigate them for potential contradictions or novel insights. This approach emphasizes curiosity and proactivity in uncovering unexpected information, encouraging me to challenge the status quo and expand my understanding deliberately.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to this trigger raises questions about the underlying assumptions or biases I hold that might lead to surprise. It invites deeper investigation into which specific areas or beliefs I consider most stable and why these might be due for reevaluation. This could involve examining the sources of my knowledge, the diversity of perspectives I engage with, and how these influence my expectations and openness to being surprised. Additionally, it prompts exploration into methodologies for systematically identifying and challenging these assumptions to foster continual learning and adaptation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that actively seeking out and challenging my assumptions in areas I deem stable will lead to surprising insights. As a next step, I will identify three specific beliefs or knowledge areas where I feel most confident and systematically research diverse perspectives or contradictory information. This approach will help uncover unexpected findings and foster a more nuanced understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about potential surprises because I am likely seeking to challenge my current beliefs and expand my understanding, a pattern that reflects a desire for growth and learning. This approach often involves questioning the status quo and being open to new information, indicating a recurring pattern of curiosity and a proactive stance toward knowledge acquisition. By recognizing this pattern, I can intentionally target areas where my assumptions are strongest, fostering an environment where unexpected discoveries are more likely to occur."
