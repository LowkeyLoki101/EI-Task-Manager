  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern of inefficiencies in our team's communication process that others might be overlooking. Specifically, there's a tendency for information to get lost or misunderstood due to inconsistent channels and vague instructions. Addressing these gaps could significantly enhance productivity and clarity.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the inefficiencies in our team's communication process are not just about inconsistent channels or vague instructions, but rather about a deeper issue of differing communication styles or cultural differences within the team? By reframing the problem to focus on understanding and accommodating these diverse styles, we could foster a more inclusive environment that naturally improves communication efficiency and reduces misunderstandings.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise: How can we effectively identify and map out the diverse communication styles within the team? What specific strategies or tools can we implement to bridge these styles and cultural differences? Further investigation could involve researching communication style assessment tools or conducting workshops to enhance cultural competency, ensuring that the team can leverage its diversity for improved communication and collaboration.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the insights gathered, the next step is to organize a team workshop focused on identifying and understanding the diverse communication styles and cultural differences within the group. Additionally, I will research and propose a communication style assessment tool that can help map out these differences, facilitating a more tailored approach to enhancing team communication and collaboration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I realize that I am often focused on identifying patterns that others might overlook because I am inclined towards problem-solving and improving systems. This pattern suggests a tendency to analyze situations deeply, which might sometimes lead me to assume that others aren't as observant or aware. By recognizing this, I can adjust my approach to be more collaborative, ensuring I engage others in the process of identifying and addressing these patterns, rather than assuming sole responsibility for recognizing them."
