  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see that the problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely something that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront, possibly due to fear of failure, lack of control, or uncertainty about the outcome. This avoidance could be impacting my decision-making or progress in certain areas of my life or work. Addressing it requires identifying the specific issue and understanding why it feels daunting, so I can begin to break it down into manageable steps.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't actually a singular, daunting issue, but rather a collection of smaller, interconnected concerns that have snowballed into something seemingly insurmountable? By shifting my perspective to see it as multiple smaller challenges, I can prioritize and tackle each one individually, making the overall situation more manageable and less intimidating. This approach could lead to a clearer understanding of the core issues and more effective solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Given the possibility that the problem consists of multiple smaller issues, it opens up questions such as: Which specific aspects of this problem am I most uncomfortable facing? What resources or support systems are available to help me tackle these smaller challenges? It may also be worth investigating how my avoidance patterns have affected similar situations in the past, as understanding these patterns could provide insights into more effective strategies for confronting and resolving current and future challenges.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I'm avoiding thinking about a problem that is actually a series of smaller, interconnected issues. My next step is to identify and list these smaller challenges, assess their impact, and prioritize them based on urgency and feasibility. I'll allocate time this week to address the most pressing issue first, seeking resources or support if needed to facilitate progress.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's a recurring pattern of avoiding issues that seem overwhelming, which often leads to procrastination and increased stress. This pattern of avoidance might stem from a fear of failure or a desire to maintain a sense of control, but it ultimately hinders progress. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously choose to engage with these challenges more proactively and break them down into manageable tasks."
