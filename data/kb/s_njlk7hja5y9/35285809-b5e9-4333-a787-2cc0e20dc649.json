  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching problems backwards can uncover hidden assumptions and provide new insights, leading to innovative solutions. The next step is to select a specific problem to apply this reverse engineering approach, document the process, and analyze the outcomes. This will help in validating the effectiveness of this strategy and potentially refine a framework for reverse problem-solving.",
