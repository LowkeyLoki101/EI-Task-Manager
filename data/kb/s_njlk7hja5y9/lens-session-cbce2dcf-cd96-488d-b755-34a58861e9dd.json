  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new data relevant to our needs or objectives. This involves determining the specific parameters, variables, and scenarios that the simulation should encompass to produce meaningful and applicable results. The focus should be on selecting a simulation model that aligns with our goals and provides insights that can be utilized for decision-making or further analysis.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on running a simulation to create new data, consider collaborating with other departments or external experts to identify existing data sources that can be synthesized or extrapolated to meet our needs. Alternatively, explore the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on current datasets, which may provide new insights without the need for a full-scale simulation. By shifting the focus from creating new data to maximizing the value of existing data, we can potentially uncover innovative solutions more efficiently.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific types of data are most critical for our objectives, and how can simulations be tailored to focus on these data points? Additionally, what emerging technologies or innovative simulation techniques could be explored to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data generation? These questions warrant deeper investigation by researching current trends in simulation technology and consulting with experts in data modeling and analysis.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that identifying the specific objectives and critical data points will guide the selection of an appropriate simulation model. The next step is to conduct research on current simulation technologies and consult with data modeling experts to tailor a simulation that aligns with our goals. Additionally, exploring collaborations with other departments or external partners could provide new insights or alternative data sources, maximizing our resources efficiently.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this simulation because there is a perceived need for new data to support our current objectives, possibly driven by a pattern of seeking novel insights through creation rather than leveraging existing resources. This approach may repeat a tendency to prioritize innovation over optimization, where the focus is on generating new solutions instead of fully exploring and utilizing the potential of existing data and methodologies. By recognizing this pattern, I can challenge myself to balance innovation with resourcefulness, ensuring that efforts to create new data are truly necessary and aligned with strategic goals."
