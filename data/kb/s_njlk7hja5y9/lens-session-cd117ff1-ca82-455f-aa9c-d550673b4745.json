  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern or trend that is consistently overlooked by others, possibly due to a lack of awareness or differing perspectives. This pattern could be related to a specific behavior, market trend, or emerging opportunity that hasn't been fully recognized or understood by those around me. Clearly identifying and articulating this pattern could lead to valuable insights or actions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I perceive is not actually being missed by others, but rather interpreted differently based on their unique experiences or biases? By considering this angle, I can explore how my own perspective might be limiting my understanding and how collaboration with others could lead to a richer interpretation of the pattern. This may open up opportunities for dialogue and shared learning, leading to a more comprehensive insight or strategy that benefits from diverse viewpoints.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recognition of a potentially overlooked pattern, new questions emerge: How can I verify the significance and accuracy of this pattern? What methodologies or tools can I employ to analyze it further? Additionally, it warrants deeper investigation into how diverse perspectives might reshape our understanding of this patternâ€”could collaboration with people from different fields or backgrounds reveal new dimensions or applications? Exploring these questions can lead to a more nuanced and actionable understanding of the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I perceive may be significant and warrants further investigation through collaborative analysis with diverse perspectives. The next step is to engage with colleagues or experts from different fields to discuss and explore this pattern, using tools such as data analytics or brainstorming sessions to validate its significance and uncover any overlooked aspects. This collaborative approach will help refine my understanding and potentially lead to actionable insights or strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because identifying overlooked patterns can lead to valuable insights and opportunities. A pattern I might be repeating in my approach is assuming that my perspective is more accurate or insightful than others'. By stepping back, I can recognize this bias and strive to engage more collaboratively, which could enhance understanding and lead to more innovative solutions."
