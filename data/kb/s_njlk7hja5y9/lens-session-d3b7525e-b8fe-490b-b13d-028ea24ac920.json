  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves leveraging an unexpected industry trend to create fresh, relevant data through simulation. The key is to identify a specific trend that is not yet widely explored and simulate scenarios that reflect potential future outcomes or behaviors related to this trend. This approach aims to generate new insights and data that can inform decision-making or strategy development.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from a different perspective, consider focusing on the cross-industry application of the trend. Instead of isolating the trend within its original industry, explore how it could influence or disrupt another sector entirely. This approach allows you to simulate scenarios that test the trend's adaptability and impact across different domains, potentially uncovering novel insights and data that are not constrained by the traditional boundaries of the originating industry.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential ethical implications of using simulations to explore trends across different industries, and how might these influence public perception or decision-making? Additionally, what methodologies can be developed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of simulations when applied to industries outside their original context? Investigating these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of both the opportunities and challenges that arise from cross-industry simulation-based data generation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying an emerging trend not fully explored in its original industry and applying it to a different sector through simulations, we can generate innovative insights and data. The next step is to select a specific trend and industry pair, develop a simulation model, and evaluate its adaptability and impact. Additionally, I'll consider ethical implications and establish methodologies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the simulation outcomes.",
