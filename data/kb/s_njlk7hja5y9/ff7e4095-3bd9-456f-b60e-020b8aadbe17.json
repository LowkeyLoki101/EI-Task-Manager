  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a recurring pattern of procrastination around tasks that induce anxiety or fear of failure. The next step is to schedule a specific time to confront this problem, breaking it into smaller, manageable tasks to reduce overwhelm. Additionally, I'll reflect on past experiences to identify successful strategies I've used in similar situations and apply them here to build confidence and resilience.",
