  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the pattern I notice may be obscured for others due to cognitive biases or contextual blind spots. The next step is to conduct a small-scale study or workshop to gather diverse perspectives and test the visibility of this pattern among different groups. This could involve creating scenarios or simulations that highlight the pattern and analyzing participants' responses to identify common barriers to recognition.",
