The next step is to conduct a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis that includes assessing AI's potential negative impacts, such as security vulnerabilities and ethical concerns, alongside its benefits. This will involve gathering case studies and expert opinions to inform a balanced strategy for AI deployment in the energy sector.",
