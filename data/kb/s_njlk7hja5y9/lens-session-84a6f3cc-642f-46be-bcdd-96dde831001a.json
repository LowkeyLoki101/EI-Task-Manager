  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify a specific simulation that can generate new and relevant data tailored to our objectives. The problem involves determining the parameters, variables, and desired outcomes of the simulation to ensure it provides valuable insights or solutions. This requires assessing the type of data needed and the best simulation model that can produce this data effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on running a new simulation, we looked at existing datasets to identify gaps or patterns that could guide us in designing a more effective simulation? By analyzing current data, we might uncover insights that inform the parameters and variables needed for the simulation, ensuring it addresses our objectives comprehensively. Alternatively, we could collaborate with experts in data modeling to explore innovative simulation techniques that align with emerging trends or technologies, potentially leading to novel data generation methods.",

  "recursiveStep": "What specific objectives or questions are we trying to address with the new data, and how can these guide the design of a simulation model? Additionally, what existing simulation techniques or technologies could be adapted or innovated to fit our unique needs, and who might be the experts or collaborators that could enhance our approach? Lastly, how can we evaluate the success of the simulation in terms of its ability to generate actionable insights or solutions?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by first analyzing existing datasets, I can identify specific gaps or patterns that will guide the design of a targeted simulation. The next step is to clearly define the objectives and questions we need the new data to address. Following this, I will explore current simulation technologies and consult with data modeling experts to develop a model that meets these objectives, ensuring the simulation's outcomes are both actionable and innovative.",
