  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where individuals consistently overlook subtle trends or emerging ideas that could lead to innovative solutions or improvements. This might be due to a focus on established methods or a resistance to change. Clearly identifying and highlighting these overlooked patterns can open opportunities for growth and progress.",
  "reframeStep": "What if this pattern isn't about individuals overlooking trends, but rather about the systems or environments they operate in that don't encourage or reward identifying new trends? From this angle, the focus shifts from individual oversight to systemic issues that prevent innovation. Addressing this could involve advocating for changes in organizational culture or incentives that promote exploration and recognize those who bring new ideas to the table.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, a new question emerges: How can organizations systematically identify and nurture those who have a knack for spotting subtle trends? This could lead to deeper investigation into creating training programs or workshops that develop this ability among employees. Additionally, exploring how technology, such as AI or data analytics, can support and enhance trend-spotting capabilities within a company could be worthwhile.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern of overlooked trends is less about individual oversight and more about systemic barriers within organizations. As a next step, I will propose a pilot program within my organization that includes workshops focused on trend-spotting skills and the implementation of AI tools to aid in recognizing emerging patterns. Additionally, I will advocate for changes in the organizational culture to better reward innovation and exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I realize that my focus on identifying overlooked patterns might reflect a personal inclination towards innovation and a belief in the value of fresh perspectives. This approach often repeats in my thinking, suggesting a pattern in how I value novelty over tradition. Recognizing this, I should consider balancing my enthusiasm for new ideas with an appreciation for established methods that have proven effective, thereby fostering a more holistic approach to innovation."
