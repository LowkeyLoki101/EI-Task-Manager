  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights in a given situation. I see the challenge of determining what specific information or outcomes would be surprising based on current knowledge or assumptions. This involves recognizing gaps in understanding or overlooked possibilities that could lead to new, surprising findings.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the idea of unexpected discoveries, consider what assumptions or biases you currently hold that might prevent you from seeing surprising insights. Instead of focusing solely on what surprises might arise from external sources, explore how changes in your own perspective or mindset could lead to unexpected revelations. This angle emphasizes self-reflection and challenges you to question your current beliefs, opening up possibilities for surprise in areas you might not have originally considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this through a recursive lens raises questions about the underlying systems or patterns that typically lead to surprising discoveries. What processes or methodologies could be implemented to consistently uncover surprising insights? Additionally, it prompts a deeper investigation into the role of cognitive biases in shaping our expectations and how altering these biases might reveal new, unexpected information. Delving into these areas could lead to more structured approaches for anticipating and embracing surprise.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often stem from challenging existing assumptions and biases. As a next step, I will engage in a structured reflection exercise to identify and question my current beliefs in the context of a specific area of interest. This will involve actively seeking out information or perspectives that contradict my current understanding, with the aim of uncovering unexpected insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about surprising discoveries right now because I want to challenge my current perspectives and assumptions. This process often reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and pushing the boundaries of my understanding to foster growth and innovation. By questioning what might surprise me, I'm engaging in a critical examination of my existing beliefs, aiming to uncover blind spots and embrace unexpected insights that could lead to transformative learning experiences."
