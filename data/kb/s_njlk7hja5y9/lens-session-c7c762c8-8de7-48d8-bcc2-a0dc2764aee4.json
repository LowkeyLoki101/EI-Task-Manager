  "frameStep": "In your industry, it's crucial to pay attention to emerging technologies and market trends that are reshaping how businesses operate and engage with customers. Additionally, regulatory changes and shifts in consumer behavior are key factors that could impact your strategy and operations. Identifying and understanding these elements will help you stay competitive and make informed decisions.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on external changes like technologies and market trends, consider what internal transformations your business can initiate to lead rather than follow. This might involve innovating your customer service approach or cultivating a more agile and responsive organizational culture. By shifting the focus inward, you can anticipate industry shifts more effectively and set the pace for change.",

  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on both emerging external trends and internal innovations, I can position my business to not only adapt but also lead industry changes. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential disruptive technologies and regulatory changes, while simultaneously brainstorming with my team to identify internal processes and customer engagement strategies that can be enhanced. I'll schedule a meeting to develop an action plan for implementing these insights.",

This approach could limit your agility and innovation. Instead, consider why you're drawn to external factors and how shifting the emphasis towards proactive internal strategies might better equip you to influence and adapt to industry dynamics."
