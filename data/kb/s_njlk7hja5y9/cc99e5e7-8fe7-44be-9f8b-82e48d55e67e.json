  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to unexpected connections and innovative ideas by breaking habitual thought patterns. As a next step, I will experiment with different methods of randomizing my prompts, such as using a random number generator or physically reordering them, to observe what novel insights or questions arise. I will also document the themes and patterns that consistently emerge from these shuffles to refine my approach to creative thinking.",
