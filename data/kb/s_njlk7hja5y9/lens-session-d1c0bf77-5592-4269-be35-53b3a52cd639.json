  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to identify something unexpected that would surprise me if I encountered it. This involves exploring areas or situations where my assumptions might be challenged or where I might uncover information or perspectives that differ significantly from my current understanding. The goal is to pinpoint areas of potential surprise that could lead to new insights or growth.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the original trigger, instead of focusing solely on what might surprise me, consider what unexpected discoveries would fundamentally alter my current beliefs or understanding. This shift in perspective emphasizes transformative surprises that have the potential to change my worldview or approach to problems. By concentrating on these paradigm-shifting discoveries, I open myself to deeper insights and personal growth beyond mere surprise.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, a new question that emerges is: \"What assumptions do I currently hold that, if proven wrong, would lead to a significant shift in my perspective?\" This prompts deeper investigation into identifying and challenging my core beliefs. Additionally, exploring potential areas where hidden biases might exist or where unconsidered variables could lead to unexpected outcomes becomes crucial, requiring thorough examination of my cognitive blind spots and the influences shaping my understanding.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging my core assumptions, I can uncover surprising insights that have the potential to transform my understanding. The next step is to conduct a deliberate review of my current beliefs and assumptions, particularly focusing on areas where I suspect hidden biases or unexamined influences. This process will involve seeking out diverse perspectives and engaging with information that contradicts my current viewpoints to foster meaningful growth and discovery.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this because I'm seeking opportunities for growth and transformation through unexpected discoveries. The pattern I notice is a tendency to focus on areas where my current understanding might be limited or challenged, indicating a desire to broaden my perspective and deepen my knowledge. By intentionally looking for surprises, I'm engaging in a practice of open-minded exploration, which could lead to significant personal and intellectual development."
