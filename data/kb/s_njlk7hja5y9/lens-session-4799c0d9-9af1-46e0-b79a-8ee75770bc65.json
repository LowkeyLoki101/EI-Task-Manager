  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that resonates with the current audience. The goal is to create a narrative that captures attention, engages the audience, and aligns with the brand's message and values. This involves understanding current trends, audience interests, and unique selling points of the product or service being marketed.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a new story hook, consider reframing the approach to leverage existing stories from your customer base. Tap into user-generated content or testimonials to find authentic stories that naturally align with your brand's message. This angle not only engages your audience by making them part of the narrative but also builds trust through real-life experiences.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Emerging from the idea of using customer stories as hooks, new questions arise: How can we systematically gather and curate these stories to ensure a steady pipeline of authentic content? What platforms and formats best showcase these narratives to maximize engagement and reach? Investigating these areas could involve exploring tools for social listening, customer feedback, and engagement analytics to better understand where and how these stories can be most effectively shared.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that leveraging customer stories as marketing content will create authentic and engaging narratives that resonate with the audience. The next step is to establish a process for gathering these stories, perhaps by creating a feedback loop with customers through surveys or direct outreach, and then curating them for use in marketing campaigns. I will also explore platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to determine the best formats for showcasing these stories to maximize engagement and reach.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because finding a compelling story hook is crucial for creating engaging marketing content that stands out in a saturated market. The pattern I may be repeating is focusing too much on creating something entirely new, rather than utilizing existing resources like customer stories or feedback. This realization can shift my approach to be more collaborative and authentic, leveraging real experiences to connect with the audience."
