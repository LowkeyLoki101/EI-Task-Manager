  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a potentially overlooked question that hasn't been considered recently. This involves reflecting on areas of life, work, or personal growth that might have been neglected or assumed resolved. The aim is to uncover a blind spot that could hold significance if revisited.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question you haven't asked yourself, consider reframing it as: \"What assumptions am I currently holding that haven't been challenged recently?\" This shifts the perspective from seeking a forgotten question to examining underlying beliefs that may influence your decisions and perspectives. By identifying and challenging these assumptions, you can uncover new insights and potentially transformative ideas that have been hidden beneath unexamined beliefs.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens, consider asking, \"What areas of my life have I not scrutinized for hidden assumptions?\" or \"How might my core beliefs be influencing my current challenges?\" These questions encourage deeper investigation into the roots of your thought processes and decision-making. Additionally, exploring the impact of unexamined beliefs on relationships, career choices, or personal growth can reveal areas ripe for transformative change and deeper understanding.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by examining unchallenged assumptions and their impacts on various areas of my life, I might uncover valuable insights or areas for growth. My next step is to set aside time to reflect on specific aspects such as career, relationships, and personal beliefs, and consciously identify any assumptions that haven't been questioned recently. This will involve journaling or discussing these topics with a trusted friend or mentor to gain new perspectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I'm recognizing that this thought process is driven by a desire to uncover hidden areas of growth or understanding. This pattern of introspection suggests a recurring need to ensure I'm not overlooking important aspects of my life or work. It highlights a tendency to periodically reassess and challenge my current beliefs and assumptions to foster continuous personal development and avoid stagnation."
