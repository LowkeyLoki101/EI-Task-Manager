  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "I'm assuming that AI will have a positive impact on the energy sector by improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing sustainability. If I consider the reverse—that AI may introduce challenges such as increased cybersecurity risks, job displacement, or require significant upfront investment—the outcome would shift towards a more cautious approach in integrating AI technologies, focusing on mitigating potential risks and preparing for possible drawbacks.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I reframe the assumption to consider AI as a neutral tool in the energy sector, neither inherently positive nor negative? From this angle, the outcome would depend entirely on how AI is implemented, managed, and regulated. This perspective shifts the focus towards strategic planning, ensuring ethical use, and creating balanced policies to maximize benefits while minimizing potential downsides.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger, new questions arise such as: How might different stakeholders perceive the role of AI in the energy sector, and what are their concerns or expectations? What historical examples of technology integration in energy can provide insights into potential challenges and benefits of AI implementation? These questions suggest deeper research into stakeholder analysis and historical case studies to inform a more nuanced understanding of AI's role in the energy sector.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that AI's impact on the energy sector is neither inherently positive nor negative, and its success hinges on effective implementation and management. The next step is to conduct a stakeholder analysis to understand diverse perspectives and examine historical case studies of technology integration in energy to identify both potential benefits and challenges of AI. This research will inform strategic planning and policy-making to ensure AI is used ethically and effectively.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this topic right now because there is a broader pattern in my approach where I tend to initially focus on the positive potential of new technologies like AI, possibly overlooking the complexities and challenges they might introduce. By using a meta-lens, I recognize a recurring pattern of optimism that might lead to an underestimation of potential risks, prompting me to adopt a more balanced and critical perspective in my evaluations. This awareness encourages a more comprehensive analysis that considers both the benefits and drawbacks, fostering a more resilient and adaptable strategy for integrating AI into the energy sector."
