  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that assumptions are often context-dependent, and their validity may vary across different situations. The next step is to systematically review my core assumptions, considering both their origins and how they interact with one another. I will take action by documenting these assumptions and examining them within various contexts to identify where they hold true and where they might need adjustment or re-evaluation.",
