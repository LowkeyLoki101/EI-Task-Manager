  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new data tailored to our specific needs or objectives. This involves determining the type of data required, the parameters and variables relevant to our context, and the tools or software available to execute the simulation effectively. Understanding these factors will help in selecting or designing a simulation model that can produce valuable insights or data outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the question from a different perspective, consider what real-world scenarios or phenomena you are trying to emulate or predict through simulation. Instead of focusing solely on generating data, think about the narrative or behavior you want the simulation to capture or replicate. This shift in focus can guide you to explore simulations that not only provide data but also offer insights into potential outcomes, patterns, or trends that are meaningful and relevant to your objectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, new questions arise such as: What specific outcomes or insights am I hoping to achieve with the new data generated from the simulation? How can I ensure the simulation accurately reflects real-world scenarios or behaviors? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate existing case studies or simulations in similar fields to learn from their methodologies and outcomes, ensuring that the new simulation is both innovative and grounded in proven techniques.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that we need a simulation model that closely mirrors the real-world scenarios we aim to understand or predict, ensuring the generated data is both relevant and actionable. The next step is to identify the specific parameters and variables pertinent to our objectives and explore existing simulation tools or frameworks that can be adapted or customized for our needs. I'll start by researching case studies and examples of simulations in similar contexts to inform our approach and potentially expedite the development process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's a need to generate new data that can provide fresh insights or inform decision-making. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on the technical aspects of data generation rather than considering the broader purpose or strategic value of the simulation. By stepping back, I can ensure that the simulation aligns with overarching goals and contributes meaningfully to our understanding or problem-solving efforts."
