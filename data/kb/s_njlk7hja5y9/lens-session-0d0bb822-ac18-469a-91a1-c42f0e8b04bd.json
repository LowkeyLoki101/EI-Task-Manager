  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a situation is correct, but there may be overlooked factors or evidence that challenge this perspective. This assumption could be leading me to make decisions or hold opinions that are not fully informed or accurate. It's important to identify and question these underlying assumptions to avoid potential errors in judgment.",
  "reframeStep": "From another perspective, consider the assumption that everyone else has access to the same information and perspective that I do. This reframe shifts the focus from questioning my understanding to considering the diversity of experiences and knowledge others might have. By acknowledging that others may have different insights or access to information, I can seek out these alternative viewpoints to enhance my understanding and challenge my assumptions more comprehensively.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential consequences of holding onto incorrect assumptions, and how can I systematically identify and test these assumptions in the future? Additionally, how can I create an environment where diverse perspectives are actively encouraged and integrated, helping to challenge and refine my assumptions? Exploring these questions can lead to developing strategies for continuous learning and adaptation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current assumptions may overlook diverse perspectives that could provide valuable insights. The next step is to actively seek out and engage with individuals who have different backgrounds and experiences to challenge and refine my assumptions. I will also implement a regular practice of questioning my beliefs and seeking feedback from others to continuously test and update my understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because I recognize a potential blind spot in my decision-making process, where unchecked assumptions could lead to errors. This reflects a pattern of seeking accuracy and validation in my beliefs by challenging them, indicating a desire to grow and adapt. By consistently questioning my assumptions, I aim to foster a more open-minded and informed approach to understanding the world."
