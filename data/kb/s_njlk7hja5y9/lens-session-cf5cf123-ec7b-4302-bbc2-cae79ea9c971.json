  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is determining which type of simulation to run that will effectively generate new and useful data. The focus is on identifying a simulation model that aligns with our specific goals or questions, ensuring it can produce relevant and actionable information. The aim is to select a simulation that is feasible with our current resources and capable of providing insights that we currently lack.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on which simulation to run, consider what specific gaps exist in your current understanding or data sets. Reframe the question to explore how different types of simulations could address these gaps. For instance, you might examine how a simulation could model unexpected scenarios or leverage machine learning to predict outcomes that aren't immediately apparent, thereby creating novel insights that go beyond simply generating new data.",

  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific knowledge gaps or questions that need addressing through simulation, and how might different models cater to these needs? How could the integration of advanced technologies like AI or machine learning within these simulations enhance data reliability and uncover hidden patterns? Additionally, what ethical considerations should be taken into account when creating and running these simulations to ensure the integrity and applicability of the generated data?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a simulation model incorporating machine learning algorithms could effectively generate new data by predicting outcomes and identifying patterns not immediately visible in our current data set. Next, I will conduct a needs assessment to pinpoint specific knowledge gaps and determine the most suitable simulation type. This will involve consulting with experts to ensure the simulation framework aligns with ethical standards and resource availability, leading to actionable insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Right now, I'm thinking about running a simulation to create new data because there's a need to fill specific knowledge gaps or explore scenarios not covered by existing data. This thought pattern reflects a recurring approach of seeking innovative methods to enhance understanding and decision-making through data-driven insights. By consistently focusing on simulation, I'm aligning with a strategic pattern of leveraging technology to predict, test, and visualize possible outcomes that inform and guide strategic decisions."
