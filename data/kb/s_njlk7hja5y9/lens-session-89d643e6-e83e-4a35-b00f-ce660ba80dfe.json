  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that would catch me off guard. This involves considering scenarios, facts, or outcomes that challenge my current assumptions or knowledge. By framing it this way, I can focus on areas where I am less informed or where my preconceived notions may not align with reality.",
  "reframeStep": "Let's approach this from a different angle: instead of focusing on what would surprise me personally, consider what would be surprising to someone with a completely different background or perspective. This could involve cultural, professional, or experiential differences that might highlight insights or discoveries I haven't considered. By shifting the perspective to that of another individual, it opens up the possibility of uncovering surprises in areas I might take for granted or overlook.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger, we can ask: What are the underlying assumptions or biases that might be influencing what I find surprising? What areas of knowledge do I need to explore more deeply to uncover potential surprises? Additionally, we might consider how different contexts or evolving information over time could alter what is considered surprising, prompting a deeper investigation into how these areas might change and why.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from areas outside my usual scope of inquiry or from challenging my existing assumptions. The next step is to actively seek out diverse perspectives and unfamiliar domains to broaden my understanding. I will schedule time each week to engage with materials or discussions outside my typical interests, aiming to uncover potential surprises and insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about unexpected discoveries right now because I am seeking to challenge my existing assumptions and broaden my understanding. By identifying surprises, I aim to uncover blind spots in my knowledge or perspective. This pattern of questioning reflects a broader approach of continuous learning and open-mindedness, striving to remain adaptable and receptive to new insights or ideas that may disrupt my current worldview."
