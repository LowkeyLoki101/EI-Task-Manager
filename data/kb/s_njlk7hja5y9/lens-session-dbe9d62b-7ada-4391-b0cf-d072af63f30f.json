  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying what unexpected discoveries or realizations might catch me off guard. I see this as an invitation to explore assumptions, gaps in knowledge, or overlooked areas in my life or work where surprises might occur. This involves examining both my internal thought processes and external environments to uncover hidden or overlooked elements.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on surprises as gaps or overlooked elements, what if I approached this question with curiosity about the positive or beneficial surprises that could emerge? For example, I could consider what unexpected strengths, opportunities, or connections might be hidden in my current environment or experiences. By shifting the focus to potential positives, I might uncover valuable insights or resources that I hadn't anticipated, leading to new avenues for growth or improvement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively prompts further inquiries into what underlying assumptions or blind spots might exist in my current mindset that prevent me from anticipating these surprises. It also raises the question of how I can cultivate a more open and exploratory mindset to better recognize unexpected opportunities or strengths. Additionally, investigating what tools or methods I might use to systematically uncover these hidden elements could be beneficial, such as engaging in reflective practices, seeking diverse perspectives, or leveraging data analytics for deeper insights.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected positive surprises likely exist in overlooked areas of my life, and uncovering these could lead to valuable growth. As a next step, I will actively engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or seeking feedback from others, to identify hidden strengths or opportunities. Additionally, I will explore diverse perspectives by connecting with individuals outside my usual network to gain fresh insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about surprises right now because I am looking to challenge my assumptions and discover new insights that could lead to personal or professional growth. This reflects a pattern in my approach where I often focus on identifying gaps or overlooked areas, possibly due to a desire to continuously improve and adapt. By using this meta-lens, I recognize the opportunity to balance my focus, not just on addressing deficiencies but also on uncovering hidden strengths and opportunities that can be leveraged."
