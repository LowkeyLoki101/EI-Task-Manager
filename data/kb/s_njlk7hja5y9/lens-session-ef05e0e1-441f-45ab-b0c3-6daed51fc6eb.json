  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying an unexpected trend within a specific industry and using simulation technology to generate new, relevant data. This approach aims to better understand the implications of the trend and explore potential strategies or solutions through simulated scenarios. By doing so, you can create a data-driven foundation that guides decision-making and innovation in response to the trend.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of directly focusing on the simulation of a specific industry trend, what if we first explore how other industries have successfully leveraged similar trends? By analyzing cross-industry case studies and identifying common strategies, we could then simulate these successful approaches within our industry context to generate fresh data. This reframing allows us to draw on a broader knowledge base and potentially discover innovative solutions that have worked elsewhere but are yet to be applied in our industry.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, we can explore which specific industry trends are most amenable to simulation and examine how simulations have previously been used to generate novel insights in different fields. Additionally, further research could focus on the technological advancements in simulation tools that enable the modeling of complex, unexpected trends, and how these advancements can be tailored to fit specific industry needs. This exploration might lead to identifying potential partnerships with technology providers who specialize in innovative simulation solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to identify unexpected industry trends that have been successfully addressed through simulation in other fields. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of these cross-industry case studies and then simulate these strategies within our industry context. This will involve partnering with technology providers specializing in advanced simulation tools to tailor solutions that generate fresh, actionable data.",
