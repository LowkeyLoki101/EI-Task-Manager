  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern that I notice but others do not. I see a disconnect between my observations and the perceptions of others, suggesting the pattern might be subtle or overlooked due to common biases or assumptions. This calls for clearly articulating and sharing my insights to bridge the gap in understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I keep noticing is not actually being overlooked by others, but rather interpreted differently due to diverse perspectives and experiences? Instead of assuming a gap in understanding, I could explore these alternative viewpoints to identify new insights or validate my observations. This approach might reveal that the pattern is multi-dimensional, and collaboration could enrich its interpretation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In applying the recursive lens, I should explore whether the pattern I notice is a symptom of a larger, more complex system or issue. Questions such as \"What underlying factors contribute to this pattern?\" and \"How do different contexts or environments influence this pattern's visibility?\" deserve deeper investigation. Additionally, researching how diverse perspectives might highlight different aspects of the pattern could uncover new dimensions and reveal whether the pattern itself is evolving or part of a broader trend.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I observe is a part of a larger, complex system influenced by diverse perspectives and underlying factors. The next step is to engage in collaborative discussions with others to explore these diverse viewpoints, conduct research to understand the broader context, and document any new insights or dimensions that emerge. This approach will help validate or refine my observations and could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the pattern.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern because I often find myself questioning whether my observations are unique or if others simply interpret them differently. This reflects a recurring tendency to assume that my perspective is underrepresented, which may stem from a desire to validate my insights or contribute meaningfully to discussions. By acknowledging this pattern, I can focus more on engaging with diverse viewpoints to either strengthen or reassess my observations collaboratively."
