  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the outcomes of reversing the traditional approach to solving it. By framing it as approaching the problem backwards, I see an opportunity to identify hidden assumptions, overlooked steps, or alternative solutions that might be missed with a forward-thinking approach. This could lead to innovative insights or more efficient paths to the desired outcome.",
  "reframeStep": "From a completely different perspective, consider not just reversing the order of steps, but also flipping the roles or objectives involved in the problem. What if you approached the problem by imagining the desired outcome as the starting point and worked backwards to understand the motivations and actions of each stakeholder involved? This could reveal new dynamics or priorities that were not previously considered, leading to a more holistic or empathetic solution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, a new question arises: What assumptions or biases are embedded in the traditional forward approach that might be challenged or dismantled when viewed from the end goal? Additionally, investigating this approach could lead to deeper research on methods like reverse engineering or backwards design, exploring how these strategies have been applied successfully in other fields or problems. This could further prompt inquiry into the psychological or cognitive benefits of reverse problem-solving in fostering creativity and innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can uncover hidden assumptions and gain new insights into the problem's structure and potential solutions. The next step is to identify the desired outcome clearly and map out the reverse sequence of actions needed to achieve it. I will then analyze this reverse approach for any overlooked elements or innovative strategies that can be applied to the forward approach, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the problem dynamics.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about approaching the problem backwards, you are likely engaging in a pattern of challenging conventional methods and seeking novel perspectives. This approach suggests a tendency to question established processes and explore alternative pathways, which can lead to innovative solutions or uncover blind spots. You're aiming to disrupt routine thinking to potentially discover more efficient or creative outcomes."
