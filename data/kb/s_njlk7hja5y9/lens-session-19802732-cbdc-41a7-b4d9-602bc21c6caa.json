  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience today. The goal is to capture attention quickly and engage potential customers by tapping into current trends, emotions, or challenges that they are facing. This requires understanding the audience's needs and the cultural or market dynamics influencing them right now.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on a story hook that resonates with the audience, consider the perspective of storytelling as a co-creation process with your audience. Engage them by inviting their input or reactions to shape the narrative, thereby making them partners in the story rather than just consumers. Alternatively, view the story hook as an opportunity to challenge prevailing narratives or assumptions, encouraging your audience to see things in a new light and sparking curiosity and dialogue.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "To delve deeper into the choice of a story hook for marketing content, consider what emerging cultural trends or societal shifts could influence audience perceptions. Investigate how technologies like AI or augmented reality are reshaping storytelling techniques and audience engagement. Additionally, explore how incorporating sustainable practices or social responsibility into your narrative could enhance brand authenticity and appeal to increasingly conscious consumers.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a story hook that invites audience participation and challenges prevailing narratives by incorporating themes of co-creation and social responsibility. The next step is to research current cultural trends and audience interests to find a specific angle that aligns with these themes. Once identified, I will craft a narrative that not only captures attention but also encourages audience interaction and dialogue.",
