  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The pattern I keep seeing that others might be missing is a recurring theme or trend that emerges in a specific context or situation, but goes unnoticed by most people. This could involve subtle shifts in behavior, emerging market trends, or inefficiencies in a process. Identifying this pattern clearly could provide a strategic advantage or lead to innovative solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the pattern itself, consider reframing the situation by examining who might be overlooking this pattern and why. Is it due to a lack of access to information, a different perspective, or perhaps cognitive biases that prevent them from seeing it? By understanding the reasons behind this oversight, you can tailor your approach to communicate the significance of the pattern and engage others in recognizing its potential impact.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying a recursive lens, consider exploring how the overlooked pattern could influence future developments or decisions if recognized. What potential impact could this pattern have in the long term, and how might different stakeholders benefit from understanding it? Additionally, investigate whether other similar situations exist where patterns have been missed and later identified, and how those scenarios unfolded to gather insights into effectively bringing attention to this pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I've identified, if recognized, could lead to significant improvements or innovations within its context. The next step is to gather evidence and examples that clearly demonstrate the pattern's impact and potential benefits. I will then present this information to key stakeholders in a compelling way, highlighting why this pattern should not be overlooked and how it aligns with their interests or goals.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern now because it represents an opportunity for strategic insight or innovation that others might not be capitalizing on. This pattern of identifying overlooked trends or inefficiencies is a recurring approach in how I seek to gain competitive advantages or drive positive change. By consistently focusing on what others might miss, I aim to position myself as a forward-thinking problem solver who can provide unique value."
