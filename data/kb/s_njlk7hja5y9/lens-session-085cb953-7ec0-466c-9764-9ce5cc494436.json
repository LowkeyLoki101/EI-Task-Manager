  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying and questioning the assumptions that underpin my current thinking. I am assuming that certain beliefs or perspectives are accurate without concrete evidence, which may lead to flawed conclusions or decisions. The goal is to pinpoint these assumptions and evaluate their validity to ensure more informed and rational decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what assumptions might be wrong, consider the assumptions as opportunities for exploration and learning. What if the assumptions youâ€™re questioning are not simply obstacles, but stepping stones to uncover new insights or innovative solutions? By reframing assumptions as hypotheses to be tested, you can approach your thinking with curiosity and openness, leading to potentially transformative outcomes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise: What specific methods or frameworks can I use to systematically identify and test the assumptions I hold? Additionally, how do these assumptions align or conflict with empirical evidence or alternative perspectives? Delving deeper into these questions could involve researching cognitive biases, studying decision-making frameworks like Bayesian reasoning, or engaging in dialogue with diverse groups to gain broader insights.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may not be fully aligned with available evidence or alternative perspectives. The next step is to systematically identify these assumptions and test them using a structured approach, such as conducting research on related topics or engaging in discussions with others to gain diverse perspectives. This action will help refine my assumptions and enhance my decision-making process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now to enhance my decision-making by identifying potentially flawed assumptions. This pattern of questioning assumptions is a recurring practice aimed at fostering a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. By consistently applying this approach, I can cultivate a habit of critical thinking that not only challenges existing beliefs but also embraces uncertainty as a pathway to deeper understanding and innovation."
