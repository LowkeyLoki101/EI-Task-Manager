  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand involves considering an alternative approach by working backwards from the desired outcome to the starting point. By framing this, I see a need to first clearly define the end goal and then identify the steps required to reach that goal in reverse order. This approach may reveal overlooked dependencies or assumptions in the original forward-thinking strategy.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from a different perspective, consider approaching it not just by working backwards, but by imagining the process as a series of transformations rather than steps. Instead of a linear path, think of the journey as a dynamic system where the end goal acts as an attractor state, pulling necessary elements and actions into alignment. This approach might highlight interdependencies and emergent properties that a straightforward backward analysis could miss, offering deeper insights into the interactions and flow within the system.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively exploring the approach of working backwards, we might ask: What are the potential pitfalls or limitations of reverse-engineering solutions? Could this strategy introduce biases or oversights by assuming the end goal is static or fully understood? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate how this backward approach interacts with dynamic systems where variables continuously change, and whether this method can effectively accommodate feedback loops and emergent behaviors within such systems.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards can reveal hidden dependencies and potential flaws in the original strategy. The next step is to clearly define the desired outcome and systematically identify and document each step needed to arrive at this outcome in reverse order. I will also consider dynamic elements and feedback loops to ensure the approach remains flexible and adaptive to change.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about approaching the problem backwards, I'm recognizing a pattern of seeking alternative perspectives to uncover hidden insights or assumptions. This approach reflects a broader tendency to challenge conventional problem-solving methods and to explore iterative processes that might reveal new pathways or solutions. This pattern suggests an openness to non-linear thinking and a desire to understand the underlying dynamics of complex systems, which can lead to more innovative and holistic solutions."
