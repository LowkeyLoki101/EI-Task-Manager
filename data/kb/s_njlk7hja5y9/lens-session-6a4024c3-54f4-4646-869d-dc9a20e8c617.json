  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves leveraging an unexpected industry trend to generate fresh, insightful data through simulation. The goal is to identify a trend that hasn't been fully explored or utilized within the industry and use simulation techniques to model potential outcomes or scenarios that provide new data insights. This approach can inform strategies or innovations within the industry based on predictive and exploratory analysis.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached the problem by first identifying industries where traditional data sources are scarce or unreliable, and then sought out unexpected trends within those industries to serve as a catalyst for simulation? By focusing on industries with limited data, such as emerging tech or niche markets, and pairing them with trends that challenge conventional thinking, we could create simulations that reveal entirely new insights and opportunities. This could shift the focus from simply enhancing existing data to pioneering new data landscapes in underexplored areas.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What industries currently have emerging or unexpected trends that are not fully understood or leveraged? How can we identify the specific parameters and variables needed to effectively simulate these trends? Additionally, what simulation tools and methodologies best capture the complexity and dynamism of these unexpected trends to ensure the data generated is both relevant and actionable? Investigating these areas can deepen our understanding and ability to generate novel insights through simulation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on industries with limited or unreliable traditional data sources, we can leverage unexpected trends within these sectors to develop simulations that generate fresh, actionable insights. The next step is to conduct a thorough examination of current emerging trends across various industries, identifying those that are not fully understood or utilized. Following this, I will explore and select appropriate simulation tools and methodologies tailored to effectively model these trends and their potential impacts.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this problem because I am trying to innovate within the boundaries of data-driven decision-making by exploring new methodologies. The pattern I am repeating is the tendency to look for novel intersections between different domains—such as industry trends and simulation—to uncover fresh insights. This approach reflects a broader strategy of leveraging unexpected combinations to overcome data limitations and drive new opportunities."
