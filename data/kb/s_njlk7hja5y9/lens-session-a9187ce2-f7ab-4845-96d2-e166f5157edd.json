  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is the need to identify a question that has been overlooked or neglected in my self-reflection process. I see an opportunity to delve into areas of my life or mindset that I might not be consciously evaluating, which could lead to fresh insights or personal growth. Itâ€™s about pinpointing a blind spot or an unexplored avenue that could benefit from my attention.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the focus shifted from identifying a missing question to exploring the reasons why certain questions have become neglected? Perhaps it's not about the questions themselves, but about the changes in my priorities or life circumstances that have led to these questions being overlooked. By understanding the underlying shifts in my mindset or environment, I might discover new areas for growth and reflection that align more closely with my current journey.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Using the recursive lens, a new question that emerges is: \"What life changes or shifts in priorities might have caused me to stop asking certain questions?\" This prompts further investigation into how my evolving values, relationships, or challenges have influenced my self-reflection practices. Additionally, it might be valuable to explore: \"How can I create a regular practice of revisiting previously overlooked questions to ensure they align with my current life context?\" This could lead to a more dynamic and responsive self-reflection process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some questions have been overlooked due to shifts in my life circumstances and priorities. As the next step, I will establish a regular practice of revisiting old journals or self-reflection notes to identify questions I previously found valuable but have not recently considered. This will help ensure my self-reflection process remains aligned with my current life context and growth trajectory.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger now because it represents a pattern of seeking continuous self-improvement and introspection, but it also reveals a possible tendency to overlook evolving personal needs and contexts. By asking why certain questions have been neglected, I'm addressing a deeper pattern of potentially sticking to familiar reflection paths rather than adapting to new circumstances and growth. This meta-awareness can guide me to more dynamically align my self-inquiry with my current life stage and priorities."
