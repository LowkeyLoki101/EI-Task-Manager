  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an opportunity to explore alternative methodologies by reversing the conventional approach. By identifying the desired outcome first and tracing it back to the starting point, I can uncover overlooked steps or insights. This method might reveal new strategies or highlight potential pitfalls in the traditional process.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the approach from a completely different perspective, consider viewing the problem not as something to solve but as a narrative to be told. Instead of focusing solely on reaching an outcome, concentrate on the story each step in the process tells. This shift might uncover creative solutions and foster a deeper understanding of the problem's nuances, as it encourages viewing each step as interconnected parts of a larger tale rather than isolated tasks.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the idea of solving the problem backwards raises questions like: What underlying assumptions are being challenged by reversing the approach, and how can these insights be applied to other problems? It also prompts further investigation into historical examples where reverse-engineering led to innovation, and whether there are specific sectors or types of problems where this approach consistently yields better results. This could lead to developing a systematic framework for identifying when and how reversing a problem-solving approach can be most effective.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will reveal overlooked steps and insights that can lead to innovative solutions. The next step is to identify a specific problem to apply this method to, document each step in reverse order, and assess the outcomes compared to traditional approaches. This will help determine the effectiveness of this strategy and potentially refine a framework for its application.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this approach right now because I'm seeking innovative ways to tackle challenges and avoid becoming trapped in conventional thinking patterns. This pattern of exploring problems from a reverse angle suggests a tendency towards creative problem-solving and a willingness to disrupt traditional methodologies. By consistently questioning and re-evaluating my approach, I aim to foster adaptability and uncover unique solutions that might be missed with a linear perspective."
