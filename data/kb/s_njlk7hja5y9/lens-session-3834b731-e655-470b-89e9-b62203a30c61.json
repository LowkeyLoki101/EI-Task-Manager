  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore alternative problem-solving strategies by reversing the usual order of operations. By starting with the desired outcome and working backwards, I can identify key steps and potential obstacles that might not be apparent when approaching the problem in a traditional forward manner. This backwards approach could lead to innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of the problem's structure.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, approaching the problem backwards could be seen as a way to challenge existing assumptions and biases. By deconstructing the problem in reverse, I might uncover overlooked factors or entrenched patterns that hinder progress. This angle encourages a fresh mindset, potentially revealing novel pathways and strategies that align with the ultimate objective in unexpected ways.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens to the idea of approaching the problem backwards, we can ask: What are the underlying principles of reverse problem-solving that could be applied to other areas? Additionally, how does working backwards reveal hidden assumptions or dependencies that influence our understanding of the problem? Investigating these questions could lead to the development of a systematic framework for reverse engineering challenges, enhancing problem-solving skills across various disciplines.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching problems backwards can uncover hidden assumptions and provide new insights, leading to innovative solutions. The next step is to select a specific problem to apply this reverse engineering approach, document the process, and analyze the outcomes. This will help in validating the effectiveness of this strategy and potentially refine a framework for reverse problem-solving.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because I'm seeking novel solutions and aiming to break free from conventional thought patterns that may limit creativity and innovation. This pattern of questioning established methods and exploring alternatives is a recurring approach I use to challenge my cognitive biases and to foster a more adaptable problem-solving mindset. By consistently employing this strategy, I aim to cultivate a habit of critical thinking and openness to diverse approaches."
