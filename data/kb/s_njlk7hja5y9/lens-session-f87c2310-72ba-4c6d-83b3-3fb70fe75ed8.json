  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is exploring the potential for innovation and creativity through the randomization of existing prompts. By shuffling your own prompts, you can discover unexpected combinations and perspectives that may lead to fresh insights or solutions. This approach encourages thinking outside of established patterns and can reveal hidden connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we viewed the act of shuffling prompts as a way to break free from cognitive biases and habitual thinking? Instead of just seeking new combinations, consider it as a method to challenge your current assumptions and allow for a more diverse range of perspectives. This approach not only fosters creativity but also promotes adaptability by encouraging you to engage with ideas you might typically overlook.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to determine which prompts are most effectively shuffled for maximum creative impact? Additionally, how can this practice be structured or systematized to regularly incorporate new insights into personal or team brainstorming sessions? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of how prompt randomization can be harnessed systematically to foster continuous innovation and adaptability.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to unexpected insights and solutions by breaking habitual thinking patterns. As a next step, I will develop a system for regularly shuffling and combining prompts, possibly using a digital tool or app, and incorporate this practice into my brainstorming sessions. This will help me continuously explore diverse perspectives and enhance my creative problem-solving process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now to actively disrupt my typical thought patterns and explore untapped creative potential. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking novelty and innovation by challenging existing cognitive frameworks. By adopting this approach, I aim to foster a mindset that prioritizes adaptability and openness to new ideas, enhancing my ability to think divergently and address complex problems."
