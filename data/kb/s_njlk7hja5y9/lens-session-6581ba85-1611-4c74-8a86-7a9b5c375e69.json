  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to explore areas of my life or thinking that I may have neglected or overlooked recently. The problem is identifying which important questions or self-reflections I haven't engaged with for some time, potentially missing out on insights or growth opportunities. This involves examining different aspects of my personal, professional, and emotional life to uncover any gaps in self-inquiry.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on questions you haven't asked yourself, consider what experiences or perspectives you haven't explored in a while. This shifts the focus from introspection to action, prompting you to seek out new environments, people, or activities that could stimulate fresh insights. By engaging with unfamiliar or forgotten experiences, you might naturally uncover the questions you need to ask yourself.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" new inquiries arise, such as: What areas of my life have I been avoiding or neglecting, and why? Are there recurring themes or patterns in my life that need reevaluation? Additionally, consider what tools or resources can aid in uncovering these dormant questionsâ€”perhaps journaling, meditation, or conversations with others who may offer a different perspective. Exploring these areas could lead to a deeper understanding and personal growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by engaging with new experiences and perspectives, I will naturally uncover important questions that I've neglected. The next step is to actively seek out activities or discussions that push me outside my comfort zone, such as joining a new group, trying a different hobby, or having a deep conversation with someone whose views differ from mine. This approach will likely stimulate fresh insights and highlight areas of my life that need reevaluation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because it reflects a recurring pattern of seeking self-improvement and ensuring that I'm not stagnating in my personal or professional growth. This approach often leads me to focus inward, which can sometimes limit my perspective. By recognizing this pattern, I can balance introspection with external exploration, encouraging a more holistic approach to personal development."
