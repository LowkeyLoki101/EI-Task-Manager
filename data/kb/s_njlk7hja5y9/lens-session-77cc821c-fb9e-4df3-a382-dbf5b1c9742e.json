  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about a specific problem that may be causing discomfort or anxiety, which could be related to a personal issue, a work-related challenge, or a decision I need to make. This avoidance might stem from a fear of facing potential negative outcomes or the complexity of the problem itself. Identifying the exact nature of this problem is crucial to addressing it effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't as daunting as it seems, but rather an opportunity for growth and learning? By approaching it as a chance to develop new skills or gain a deeper understanding of myself, the focus shifts from fear of negative outcomes to excitement about potential positive changes. This new perspective could motivate me to confront the issue with curiosity rather than avoidance.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By considering the problem as an opportunity for growth, I can now ask: What specific skills or insights could tackling this issue help me develop? Additionally, what are the underlying fears or assumptions that make this problem seem daunting, and how can I challenge or reframe them? Investigating whether there are smaller, manageable steps to approach the problem can also reveal a path forward, potentially reducing the overall sense of overwhelm.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is not as insurmountable as it initially seems and offers a chance for personal growth. My next step is to identify specific skills or insights I can gain by addressing this issue. I'll start by breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle one each day, while also challenging any underlying fears or assumptions that contribute to my avoidance.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about avoiding this problem right now because it may be part of a recurring pattern where I sidestep discomfort and uncertainty, opting instead for short-term comfort. This avoidance pattern might indicate a deeper resistance to vulnerability and change, which I need to address to break free from the cycle of fear-driven procrastination and instead embrace challenges as opportunities for growth."
