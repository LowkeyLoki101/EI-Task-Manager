  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying potentially incorrect assumptions I'm making. I see a need to critically evaluate my current beliefs and perspectives to uncover any biases or misconceptions that might be influencing my thinking or decision-making. It's essential to pinpoint these assumptions to ensure they don't lead to flawed conclusions or actions.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the assumption not as potentially wrong, but as an opportunity for growth and learning. Instead of focusing solely on identifying errors in my thinking, I could view these assumptions as stepping stones that guide me toward more informed and nuanced understanding. This shift encourages a mindset of curiosity and openness, allowing me to embrace uncertainty as a valuable part of the learning process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific assumptions do I hold that warrant further investigation, and how can I systematically identify and evaluate them? Could exploring the origins and influences of these assumptions reveal deeper societal or cultural biases that I need to address? Additionally, how might regularly revisiting and questioning these assumptions improve my critical thinking skills and adaptability over time?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by cultural biases or outdated information. As a next step, I will systematically list these assumptions and investigate their origins and validity. I will also commit to regularly revisiting these assumptions and discussing them with trusted peers to enhance my critical thinking and adaptability.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I recognize a recurring pattern in my approach: I often default to a defensive mindset, focusing on identifying errors to prevent mistakes. This pattern might limit my ability to see assumptions as opportunities for exploration rather than solely as potential pitfalls. By stepping back, I can foster a more balanced approach that values both critical evaluation and the potential for growth and learning through uncertainty."
