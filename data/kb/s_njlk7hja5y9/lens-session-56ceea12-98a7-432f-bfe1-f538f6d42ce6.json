  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a question that I once found important or insightful but haven't revisited recently. This involves reflecting on past inquiries that might have been crucial for personal growth, decision-making, or understanding my current situation better. The goal is to uncover a potentially overlooked area that could provide valuable insights or drive meaningful change.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on past questions that might have been crucial, consider looking at the present moment and asking, \"What is a question I've never thought to ask myself before?\" This shift opens up the possibility of exploring entirely new areas of curiosity or concern, potentially leading to fresh insights and innovations. By approaching your inquiry from this angle, you invite a sense of discovery and broaden the scope of introspection beyond revisiting the past.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In exploring new areas of curiosity, consider asking, \"What assumptions am I currently making about my life that I haven't questioned?\" or \"What possibilities exist in my current circumstances that I've overlooked?\" These questions encourage a deeper investigation into the underlying beliefs guiding your decisions and highlight potential opportunities for growth and change. Further research could involve examining how these assumptions were formed and exploring strategies to challenge or expand them.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by focusing on uncovering assumptions or overlooked possibilities in my current life, I can gain fresh insights and drive personal growth. The next step is to regularly set aside time for introspection, specifically asking questions like, \"What assumptions am I making that need re-evaluation?\" and \"What new opportunities am I not seeing right now?\" This practice will help maintain a dynamic understanding of my life and encourage continuous development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger because it taps into the human tendency to revisit and reflect on familiar patterns of thought, often seeking comfort or validation from past experiences. By recognizing this pattern, I can become aware of how frequently I rely on past inquiries for guidance and challenge myself to break free from this cycle, encouraging more innovative and forward-thinking approaches to personal growth and understanding."
