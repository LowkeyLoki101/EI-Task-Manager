  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that AI will predominantly have a positive impact on the energy sector by optimizing processes and increasing efficiency. If I consider the reverse, I would explore the potential negative impacts, such as job displacement, increased energy consumption due to AI operations themselves, or even the risk of over-reliance on technology leading to vulnerabilities. This shift in perspective could lead to a more balanced approach to integrating AI, where both potential benefits and risks are carefully managed.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from a different perspective, consider the cultural and ethical dimensions of AI in the energy sector. Instead of focusing solely on technological and economic impacts, explore how AI might influence societal values, equity in energy access, and the ethical implications of decision-making automation. This could lead to outcomes where the integration of AI not only optimizes efficiency but also aligns with societal goals such as sustainability, inclusivity, and fairness.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: How might the integration of AI in the energy sector inadvertently lead to increased environmental impact, contradicting its intended purpose of promoting sustainability? Additionally, what are the long-term socio-economic effects of AI on energy access in developing regions? Investigating these areas could provide deeper insights into unintended consequences and guide the development of more comprehensive policies that address both positive and negative outcomes of AI deployment in energy.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI can drive efficiency and optimization in the energy sector, it also poses risks of environmental impact, job displacement, and ethical concerns. As a next step, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of both the positive and negative impacts of AI in this sector, focusing on developing balanced policies that mitigate risks while maximizing benefits. This includes engaging with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to incorporate cultural, ethical, and socio-economic perspectives into AI integration strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I am recognizing a pattern in my approach where I tend to focus on the positive impacts of technological advancements like AI, potentially overlooking the broader implications. This reflection prompts me to question whether my thinking is consistently driven by optimism bias, and encourages me to adopt a more critical and comprehensive perspective that includes potential downsides and socio-ethical considerations. This shift can lead to more balanced decision-making that accounts for a wider range of outcomes and stakeholder impacts."
