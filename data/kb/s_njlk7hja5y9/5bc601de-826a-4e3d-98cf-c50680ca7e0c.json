  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is tied to a fear of failure or discomfort, which can be addressed by reframing it as an opportunity for growth. My next step is to identify specific tasks or conversations I'm avoiding, write down the fears associated with them, and develop a small, actionable plan to address each one, starting with the least intimidating. This approach will help break down the overarching issue into manageable parts, making it easier to tackle systematically.",
