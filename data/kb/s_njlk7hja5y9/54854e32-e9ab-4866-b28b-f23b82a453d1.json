  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the patterns I observe may not be entirely overlooked by others, but rather understood differently due to diverse perspectives and priorities. As a next step, I will organize a team meeting to openly discuss these patterns and invite feedback, aiming to collaboratively explore and validate these observations. This dialogue will help uncover any hidden insights or constraints, fostering a more comprehensive approach to addressing these inefficiencies and opportunities.",
