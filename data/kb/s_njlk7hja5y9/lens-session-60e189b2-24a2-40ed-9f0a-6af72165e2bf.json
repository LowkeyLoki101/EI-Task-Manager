  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is the assumption that AI in the energy sector will always lead to positive outcomes such as increased efficiency and cost savings. By framing this, I see that if I consider the reverse—where AI could potentially introduce risks like data security issues or exacerbate energy inequality—the outcome might shift towards needing more robust regulations and ethical considerations. This perspective could lead to more balanced and cautious implementation strategies.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the assumption that AI in the energy sector could inherently be detrimental, perhaps leading to job losses or environmental harm. By reframing this to consider the opposite—that AI could create new job opportunities, foster environmental innovations, and enhance sustainable practices—the outcome might shift towards prioritizing AI integration and training programs. This approach could drive investments in AI that align with sustainable and equitable growth within the energy sector.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens on this trigger raises additional questions such as: What specific factors could influence whether AI in the energy sector leads to positive or negative outcomes? How do geopolitical, social, and economic contexts affect AI implementation and its consequences? These questions point to the need for deeper research into case studies of AI applications in energy across different regions, as well as the development of frameworks to assess potential risks and benefits in varying contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that AI integration in the energy sector has both potential benefits and risks, and these outcomes are highly context-dependent. The next step is to conduct detailed research into case studies of AI applications in different regions, focusing on both successful implementations and challenges faced. Additionally, I will develop a framework to evaluate AI's impact on energy efficiency, job markets, and environmental sustainability, ensuring a balanced approach to AI adoption.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about the assumptions around AI in the energy sector because it's critical to challenge and expand my perspective to ensure comprehensive understanding and strategic planning. This pattern of questioning assumptions helps prevent bias and encourages innovative solutions by considering both positive and negative potential outcomes. By applying this meta-lens, I can develop more resilient and adaptable strategies that account for a broader range of scenarios and consequences."
