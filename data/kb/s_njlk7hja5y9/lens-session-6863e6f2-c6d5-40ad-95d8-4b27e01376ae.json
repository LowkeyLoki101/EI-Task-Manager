  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves the assumption that AI will positively transform the energy sector by enhancing efficiency and sustainability. If I consider the reverse, I must explore the possibility that AI could lead to increased energy consumption due to higher computational demands or unintended inefficiencies. This alternative perspective could significantly impact how AI is integrated into energy strategies and policies.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from the perspective of societal impact, one could consider the assumption that AI's role in the energy sector will create equitable benefits across different communities. By exploring the reverse, you might consider that AI could exacerbate existing inequalities, favoring regions with advanced technological infrastructure over less developed areas. This perspective prompts a reassessment of how AI integration strategies can be inclusive and equitable, ensuring that advancements do not disproportionately benefit certain groups.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying a recursive lens, we can explore deeper questions such as: How can AI in the energy sector be designed to minimize energy consumption while maximizing efficiency? What measures can be put in place to ensure that AI tools do not exacerbate inequalities in energy access? Further investigation could involve case studies of AI deployment in diverse regions to identify best practices and potential pitfalls, as well as the development of frameworks to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of AI in energy. These inquiries could guide future policies and innovations toward more sustainable and equitable outcomes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI holds the potential to revolutionize the energy sector, it also brings risks of increased energy consumption and exacerbated inequalities. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of case studies where AI has been implemented in the energy sector, focusing on energy consumption patterns and socio-economic impacts. I will also develop a framework to evaluate and mitigate these risks, ensuring that AI integration is both energy-efficient and socially equitable.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I'm examining why I'm considering the assumption about AI's impact on the energy sector now. This reflection might reveal a broader pattern of evaluating technological advancements purely through an optimistic lens, without fully accounting for potential negative consequences or disparities. Recognizing this pattern can lead to a more balanced approach, ensuring that I assess both the positive and negative implications of technological integration in various sectors."
