  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see that I'm questioning the validity of my assumptions, which implies a need to identify and challenge preconceived notions that might be leading to incorrect conclusions or actions. The problem is understanding which specific assumptions could be flawed and how they might impact my decision-making or understanding of a situation. This requires a systematic examination of these assumptions to determine if they are based on outdated information, biases, or misinterpretations.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, consider approaching the situation with curiosity about the potential benefits of testing these assumptions. What new opportunities or insights could arise if you actively seek out evidence that challenges your current beliefs? By reframing the trigger as an exploration for growth rather than a critique of errors, you might discover innovative solutions or perspectives that were previously overlooked.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise such as: What specific biases could be influencing my current assumptions, and how can I systematically identify them? Additionally, how can I incorporate diverse perspectives or expert opinions to test the validity of these assumptions? This recursive approach suggests deeper research into cognitive biases and effective methods for assumption testing, such as scenario analysis or peer review, to ensure a comprehensive understanding and more accurate decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions are influenced by cognitive biases or outdated information. The next step is to systematically identify these assumptions and test their validity by seeking diverse perspectives and expert opinions. I will take action by organizing a peer review session or conducting scenario analyses to challenge and refine my current beliefs, enhancing my decision-making process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about challenging my assumptions right now because I often rely on existing beliefs without questioning their validity, which could lead to stagnation or mistakes. This pattern of focusing on assumptions might stem from a habit of seeking certainty, but stepping back with a meta-lens reveals an opportunity to embrace uncertainty and growth by actively seeking out and learning from disconfirming evidence."
