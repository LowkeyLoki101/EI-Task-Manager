  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new and relevant data for us. This requires understanding the specific area or field where new data is needed, as well as determining the parameters and variables that the simulation must incorporate to produce useful outcomes. Essentially, we need to define the purpose and scope of the simulation to ensure it aligns with our data needs.",
  "reframeStep": "Let's shift the focus from creating new data to enhancing the understanding of existing data through simulation. Instead of generating entirely new datasets, consider running simulations that model different scenarios using the current data. This approach allows us to explore potential outcomes and gain deeper insights, which can be just as valuable as new data. By leveraging what we already have, we can make more informed decisions and guide future data collection efforts.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of running simulations to enhance understanding, a key question is: what specific scenarios or variables should be modeled to provide the most valuable insights? Additionally, it's worth investigating which existing datasets could be integrated to augment the simulation's accuracy and relevance. Another area for deeper research could be exploring advanced simulation techniques, such as agent-based modeling or machine learning algorithms, to better predict complex system behaviors and outcomes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that instead of creating entirely new data, we should focus on running simulations using existing datasets to model various scenarios. The next step is to identify key variables and scenarios that align with our data needs and objectives. I will also explore integrating advanced simulation techniques, like agent-based modeling or machine learning, to enhance the accuracy and insights of our simulations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about running simulations to create new data because there is a drive to innovate and enhance decision-making with fresh insights. This approach reflects a recurring pattern of seeking novel solutions through data generation, rather than fully leveraging existing information to its maximum potential. By recognizing this pattern, I can redirect focus towards optimizing current data and employing simulations to deepen understanding, rather than defaulting to generating entirely new datasets."
