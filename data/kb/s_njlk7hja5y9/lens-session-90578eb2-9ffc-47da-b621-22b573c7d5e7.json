  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a personal or professional issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront. It could be related to a difficult decision, a conflict with someone, or a task that requires significant effort or emotional investment. By identifying this, I can begin to address why it is challenging and what steps I might take to confront it.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from another angle, consider that the issue you are avoiding might not necessarily be a problem but an opportunity for growth or change. Instead of viewing it as a daunting challenge, see it as a chance to learn new skills, strengthen relationships, or improve your situation. By shifting your perspective to view the situation as a positive catalyst, you may feel more motivated and less intimidated to address it.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the problem further, consider what underlying fears or beliefs might be contributing to your avoidance. Are there specific outcomes you fear, or is there a lack of confidence in your ability to handle the situation? Additionally, investigate what resources or support systems you could leverage to assist in addressing the issue, such as seeking advice from a mentor or engaging in professional development. These questions can help uncover deeper insights and guide actionable steps to confront and resolve the problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I am avoiding is a significant personal or professional challenge that feels daunting due to underlying fears or a lack of confidence. The next step is to clearly define the issue and set a small, manageable goal to address it. I will also seek support from a trusted mentor or friend to gain perspective and encouragement.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because it's important to identify and confront issues that may be hindering my personal or professional growth. The pattern I might be repeating is avoiding discomfort by procrastinating or distracting myself, which prevents me from addressing the root cause of my stress. Recognizing this tendency can help me develop more effective strategies to face challenges head-on and create a more proactive approach to problem-solving."
