  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that combining unexpected industry trends with simulation requires a dual approach: integrating qualitative insights with advanced technological tools to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the simulated data. The next step is to identify a specific industry trend lacking substantial data, and then collaborate with both industry experts and data scientists to design simulations that incorporate qualitative research findings. This will ensure that the simulations not only predict outcomes but also capture the human factors driving the trend.",
