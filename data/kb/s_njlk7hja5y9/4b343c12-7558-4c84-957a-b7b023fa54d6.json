  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can uncover hidden insights and streamline the problem-solving process by highlighting essential steps and eliminating redundancies. As a next step, I will apply this reverse-engineering approach to a current project, documenting the process to identify any obstacles or innovative solutions that emerge. This will help assess its effectiveness and potential for broader application.",
