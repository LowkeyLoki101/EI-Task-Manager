  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore the problem from a new perspective by reversing the usual order of operations. This involves starting from the desired outcome and tracing the steps back to the initial conditions, which might reveal hidden assumptions or alternative solutions. By framing the problem backwards, I can identify potential pitfalls and unexpected insights that are not apparent when approaching it in a conventional, forward manner.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider approaching the problem in a circular or iterative manner rather than strictly backwards. Instead of solely tracing steps in reverse, envision the process as a loop where each step informs the next, allowing you to continuously refine your approach based on feedback from each cycle. This iterative loop can reveal dynamic interactions between steps, leading to a more adaptive and resilient solution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the problem backwards raises new questions about the assumptions underlying each step when reversed. It would be beneficial to investigate how reversing the sequence might affect dependencies between steps, potentially uncovering hidden constraints or opportunities. Additionally, considering what feedback loops could be established in a backward approach could lead to insights on making the process more efficient or innovative.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards or iteratively can uncover hidden assumptions and reveal alternative solutions that aren't visible with a forward-only approach. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work backwards to identify each step, noting any assumptions and dependencies along the way. I will also establish a feedback loop to continuously refine the approach based on insights gained from each iteration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I'm seeking innovative solutions and aiming to break out of conventional patterns that might limit my understanding. This pattern of reversing perspectives reflects a desire to challenge assumptions and uncover hidden dynamics. By doing so, I can develop a more holistic view of the problem, allowing for creative problem-solving and enhanced adaptability."
