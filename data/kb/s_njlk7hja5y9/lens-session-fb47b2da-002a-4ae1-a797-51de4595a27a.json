  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a unique and untapped story angle within the evolving field of solar technology. Specifically, the focus is on discovering a surprising pattern or trend that hasn't been widely recognized or explored by others. This requires analyzing current solar technology developments for unexpected shifts or innovations that could captivate an audience.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on technological advancements in solar technology, consider reframing the story to explore the socio-economic impacts these advancements might have in unexpected regions or communities. For instance, investigate how a particular solar technology is transforming energy accessibility in remote areas, creating new economic opportunities, or altering social dynamics in ways that haven't been widely reported. This approach shifts the focus from purely technology to its broader implications, providing a fresh and compelling narrative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Considering the recursive lens, new questions that emerge might include: How are recent advancements in solar technology influencing cultural practices or lifestyles in unexpected ways? Are there specific regions where solar technology is spurring innovation in other industries, such as agriculture or transportation, leading to broader socio-economic transformations? Deeper investigation could focus on niche applications of solar technology, like solar-powered desalination projects in arid regions, and how they are reshaping local economies and ecosystems.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in examining how solar technology is unexpectedly influencing socio-economic dynamics in remote or underserved regions. As a next step, I will research case studies and conduct interviews with stakeholders in these areas to uncover specific examples of solar technology driving unforeseen cultural or economic shifts. This actionable approach will help develop a narrative that highlights underreported impacts of solar advancements.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this trigger through a meta-lens, I'm prompted to question my underlying motivations and habitual thought patterns. Currently, I might be driven by a desire to uncover untold stories or to differentiate my work in a crowded field. This pattern suggests a tendency to seek novelty and exclusivity, aiming to not just inform but also to captivate and challenge conventional narratives. This reflection can guide me to prioritize stories that not only highlight unexpected patterns in solar technology but also resonate with broader societal and environmental themes."
