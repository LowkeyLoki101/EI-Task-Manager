  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I notice a recurring pattern where people tend to overlook subtle shifts in market trends or consumer behaviors that indicate a larger change on the horizon. While others focus on immediate metrics, I'm seeing early warning signals that suggest a need for strategic adaptation. This could be a valuable opportunity to position ourselves ahead of the curve.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern isn't about others missing subtle shifts, but rather about a different way of interpreting the same data? Instead of seeing it as an oversight, consider that others might have a different risk tolerance or strategic priority that makes them intentionally dismiss these shifts. This perspective suggests that the real opportunity lies in understanding why these differences in interpretation exist and leveraging that knowledge to align strategies with diverse stakeholder objectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, further questions arise about the underlying drivers of these subtle shifts in market trends or consumer behaviors. What specific factors are contributing to these changes, and how might they evolve over time? Additionally, is there a historical pattern or precedent that can offer insights into the potential outcomes of these shifts? Investigating these questions could reveal deeper insights into the root causes and future implications, offering a strategic advantage in anticipating and responding to market dynamics.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the divergence in interpretation of subtle market shifts stems from varying risk tolerances and strategic priorities among stakeholders. My next step is to conduct a detailed analysis of these shifts, focusing on the underlying drivers and historical precedents, to develop a strategic framework that aligns with diverse stakeholder objectives. This will involve stakeholder engagement to understand their perspectives and priorities, ensuring that the strategy is comprehensive and inclusive.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern now because I have a tendency to focus on identifying opportunities that others may overlook, which often aligns with my interest in strategic foresight and innovation. This recurring approach might reflect a pattern of seeking validation through being ahead in insights, which could drive my decision-making process. Recognizing this pattern allows me to question whether my focus is skewed towards innovation for its own sake, rather than balancing it with practical alignment with current organizational goals and collective readiness for change."
