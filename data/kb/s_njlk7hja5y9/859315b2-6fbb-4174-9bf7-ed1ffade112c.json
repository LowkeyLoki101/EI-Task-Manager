  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the recurring inefficiencies in team communication are symptoms of deeper issues such as lack of trust or differing priorities. The next step is to conduct a survey or hold one-on-one interviews to gather insights on team members' perceptions of communication and trust within the team. Based on these findings, I will propose targeted interventions, such as team-building activities or workshops, to address these underlying issues and improve overall communication.",
