  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a recurring pattern or trend that is evident to me but not noticeable to others. This could involve recognizing a specific set of circumstances, behaviors, or outcomes that consistently occur and have implications that are not immediately apparent to those around me. The goal is to articulate this pattern clearly and understand why it might be overlooked by others.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the pattern itself, consider the possibility that the differences in perception might stem from varying perspectives, experiences, or biases among those around you. Perhaps the pattern is not inherently obvious but is viewed through a specific lens that only you possess due to unique experiences or knowledge. By understanding these differences, you might find ways to communicate or demonstrate the pattern in a manner that resonates more clearly with others, highlighting its significance from their viewpoint.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to this trigger invites further exploration into why this pattern is uniquely perceivable to you. What aspects of your background, expertise, or cognitive processes enable you to see this pattern? Additionally, consider investigating whether there are similar patterns in different contexts that others also overlook, which might suggest a broader tendency in human perception or cognitive biases. This could lead to deeper research into how specific experiences shape pattern recognition and what methods can be used to bridge perception gaps between individuals.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I perceive is influenced by my unique background or cognitive processes, which might not be shared by others. As a next step, I will aim to articulate this pattern more clearly by considering perspectives outside my own and identifying potential cognitive biases. Additionally, I will seek feedback from peers with different experiences to validate the pattern's significance and explore methods to communicate it effectively to a broader audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm considering why this question about patterns keeps arising for me. This suggests I might have a tendency to notice patterns due to a heightened awareness or analytical mindset, possibly driven by a desire to solve problems or improve outcomes. This recurring focus may indicate a personal pattern of seeking validation or understanding, suggesting that I could benefit from exploring why I value identifying patterns and how it aligns with my goals or needs."
