  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring the potential for creativity and innovation by rearranging familiar elements—in this case, prompts—to see what novel ideas or questions arise. It involves taking existing prompts and mixing them in different ways to generate fresh perspectives or insights that might not have been considered before. This process could lead to uncovering new angles or solutions by breaking out of routine thought patterns.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the potential for creativity and innovation through the shuffling of prompts, we looked at this as an exercise in self-discovery? By rearranging prompts or questions you’ve created, it might reveal underlying themes or priorities in your thinking that you hadn't previously recognized. This could provide insight into your own cognitive patterns, preferences, or areas of interest that could be further explored or developed.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Shuffling your own prompts could raise new questions about the nature of creativity and how randomness can lead to unexpected insights. This process might also warrant deeper investigation into how different contexts or environments affect the interpretation of these newly formed prompts. Additionally, exploring the underlying cognitive mechanisms that allow for the recognition of novel patterns from shuffled prompts could reveal more about human problem-solving and ideation processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my own prompts can lead to both creative insights and self-discovery by revealing underlying themes in my thinking. The next step is to actively shuffle a set of my prompts and document any new questions or themes that emerge. This can be followed by analyzing these outcomes to identify patterns and areas for further exploration or development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts to explore not just creativity, but also to gain insights into my cognitive processes and preferences. This reflects a pattern of seeking to understand my own thought structures and potentially uncovering new personal insights. By stepping back, I can recognize a recurring desire to break routine and challenge my own thinking patterns, which could guide future actions toward more intentional self-reflection and growth."
