As a next step, I'll set aside dedicated time each week for reflective journaling, focusing on areas I haven't explored recently, such as personal relationships and long-term career ambitions. Additionally, I'll seek out new experiences or engage in conversations with diverse individuals to naturally surface fresh questions and perspectives.",
