  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying which assumptions I hold that could be incorrect. I need to clearly list out my assumptions related to the issue at hand and evaluate each one for validity. This will help me pinpoint any faulty reasoning or beliefs that could be influencing my understanding or decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially wrong assumptions, consider approaching the issue by exploring diverse perspectives and seeking feedback from others. This broader view could reveal assumptions you weren't even aware of and offer new insights. By engaging with different viewpoints, you might uncover hidden biases or blind spots that would remain obscured with a narrow focus on self-evaluation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific methods can I use to identify assumptions that I might not be consciously aware of? Should I consider conducting a more formal self-audit or seeking external feedback to uncover these hidden assumptions? Additionally, how can I ensure that once these assumptions are identified, I have a systematic approach to test their validity and adjust my thinking accordingly?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions might be based on outdated information or personal biases that I've not yet recognized. As a next step, I'll engage in a feedback session with peers or mentors to gain external perspectives on my assumptions. Additionally, I'll conduct a self-audit using a structured framework to systematically evaluate and challenge these assumptions, ensuring that any identified biases are addressed and corrected.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying potentially wrong assumptions right now because questioning these assumptions can lead to a deeper understanding and more robust decision-making. This pattern of introspection highlights a tendency toward self-reflection and a desire for accuracy. However, it may also reveal a recurring pattern of self-doubt or over-analysis, suggesting that I might benefit from balancing internal evaluation with external input and trusting my instincts more."
