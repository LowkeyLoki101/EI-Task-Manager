  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that will engage the target audience and align with current trends and interests. The goal is to create a narrative that resonates emotionally or logically with the audience, prompting them to take action or deepen their connection with the brand. This requires understanding the audience's needs, preferences, and the context of today's cultural or market landscape.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on identifying a story hook, we shifted our perspective to collaborating directly with the audience to co-create the narrative? By involving the audience in the storytelling process, we could generate a hook that not only engages them but also empowers them, turning them into active participants in the brand's story. This approach could lead to more authentic and relatable content that naturally resonates with the audience's current interests and cultural context.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What tools or platforms can facilitate audience collaboration in creating marketing narratives, and how can these be effectively integrated into the content creation process? Additionally, how can brands ensure that the collaborative stories align with their core messages while remaining authentic to the contributors' voices? Further investigation into successful case studies of audience co-creation in marketing could provide valuable insights and strategies.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to utilize a collaborative storytelling approach by engaging the audience through interactive platforms like social media polls, co-creation contests, or community forums. The next step is to select a platform that best fits the target audience's preferences and initiate a campaign inviting them to share their stories or ideas related to the brand. This will not only help in generating a compelling story hook but also enhance audience engagement and brand loyalty.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm recognizing that my current focus is on finding an engaging story hook for marketing content. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking external validation through audience engagement rather than exploring innovative collaboration methods. By shifting my focus to co-creating with the audience, I can break away from traditional storytelling patterns and foster a deeper, more meaningful connection with them."
