  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas where my current understanding is limited or based on unchallenged assumptions. As a next step, I will actively seek out perspectives and knowledge from fields outside my usual scope, such as interdisciplinary studies or unconventional research, to uncover insights that could surprise and inform my current views. This approach will not only help in identifying potential surprises but also facilitate a more comprehensive understanding and personal growth.",
