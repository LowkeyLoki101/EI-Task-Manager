  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by selecting an unexpected industry trend, such as the rise of remote work practices, and simulating its effects in sectors like urban planning or transportation, we could generate fresh data that fosters innovative solutions across industries. The next step is to design a simulation model that captures key elements of this trend and test its applicability in different contexts to measure its impact and uncover novel applications.",
