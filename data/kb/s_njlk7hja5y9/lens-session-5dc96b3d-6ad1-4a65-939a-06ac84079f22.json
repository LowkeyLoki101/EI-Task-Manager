  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue in my life that I find uncomfortable or challenging to confront. It could be related to personal relationships, career decisions, or financial concerns that seem overwhelming or complex. By not addressing it, I might be delaying necessary actions or decisions that could lead to resolution or improvement.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the problem as an opportunity for growth rather than a daunting challenge. Instead of focusing on the discomfort it brings, view it as a puzzle that, once solved, could lead to personal development or open new doors in your life. By approaching it with curiosity and a problem-solving mindset, you might find innovative solutions that weren't initially apparent.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What problem am I avoiding thinking about?\" invites further exploration into why the problem is being avoided in the first place. This could lead to questions such as: What fears or emotions are associated with this problem? How might past experiences influence my current avoidance behavior? Additionally, investigating the potential consequences of continued avoidance and identifying any patterns of avoidance in other areas of life could provide deeper insights and guide a more comprehensive approach to addressing the issue.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a problem because it triggers discomfort or fear, possibly rooted in past experiences. As a next step, I will set aside dedicated time to journal about this issue, identifying specific fears and emotions associated with it. This reflection will help me understand its impact and guide me in creating an actionable plan to address it, moving from avoidance to proactive engagement.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem right now because it represents a recurring pattern of avoidance in my life, which might stem from a fear of failure or discomfort with uncertainty. By not confronting these issues, I may be perpetuating a cycle of avoidance that prevents me from achieving growth and resolution. Recognizing this pattern allows me to consciously shift my approach towards proactive problem-solving and embrace challenges as opportunities for development."
