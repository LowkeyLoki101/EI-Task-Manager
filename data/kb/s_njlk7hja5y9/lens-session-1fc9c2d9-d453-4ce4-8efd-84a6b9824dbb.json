  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a meaningful question that has been overlooked or neglected for some time. I need to consider areas of my life, such as personal growth, relationships, or career, where I might not have been introspective recently. By pinpointing a specific area, I can formulate a question that will help me gain new insights or address potential blind spots.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the question from a different perspective, consider asking: \"What assumptions am I making about my current life situation that I haven't challenged recently?\" This approach shifts the focus from identifying overlooked questions to examining the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape how you view various aspects of your life. By questioning these assumptions, you might uncover areas where growth or change is needed, leading to new questions that were previously hidden.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the question \"What assumptions am I making about my current life situation that I haven't challenged recently?\" leads to further inquiries such as: \"How do these assumptions shape my decision-making process, and what potential opportunities am I overlooking as a result?\" or \"What feedback mechanisms can I establish to continuously challenge and update my assumptions?\" These questions prompt deeper investigation into the habitual thought patterns that influence your life, encouraging ongoing reflection and adaptation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by examining the assumptions underlying my current life situation, I can identify overlooked opportunities and areas for growth. The next step is to consciously reflect on these assumptions by setting aside time each week to journal about them and seek feedback from trusted peers or mentors. This ongoing practice will help ensure that I remain open to new insights and adaptable to change.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because it reflects a pattern of seeking self-awareness and continuous personal development. This approach often involves revisiting and challenging my current assumptions to ensure they still align with my values and goals. By adopting this introspective habit, I aim to uncover overlooked areas that may benefit from renewed focus or change, thus fostering growth and preventing stagnation."
