  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to identify unexpected industry trends that have been successfully addressed through simulation in other fields. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of these cross-industry case studies and then simulate these strategies within our industry context. This will involve partnering with technology providers specializing in advanced simulation tools to tailor solutions that generate fresh, actionable data.",
