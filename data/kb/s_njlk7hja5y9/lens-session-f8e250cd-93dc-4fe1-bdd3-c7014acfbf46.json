  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a simulation that can generate new data relevant to our goals or research needs. This involves determining what specific outcomes or variables we want to explore or predict and selecting or designing a simulation model that accurately represents the system or process of interest. It's crucial to clearly understand the context and purpose of the simulation to ensure it produces valuable and applicable data.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from a different perspective, consider focusing on the potential for simulations to explore scenarios that are otherwise difficult or impossible to test in real life. Instead of merely generating new data, think about how a simulation can be used as a tool for hypothesis testing, risk assessment, or strategic planning. By shifting your perspective towards using simulations to uncover insights and drive decision-making, you might identify innovative approaches and models that offer more than just raw data, but actionable intelligence.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider asking what specific types of insights or decisions the new data will inform and how these needs might evolve over time. Additionally, explore whether there are existing simulation models that can be adapted or combined to better address complex, multi-dimensional questions. Investigating the potential for ongoing iterations of the simulation could also reveal deeper patterns or trends as more variables and scenarios are tested.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying the specific outcomes or decisions we aim to influence, we can design or select a simulation model that effectively generates relevant data. The next step is to outline the key variables and scenarios that need exploration, and then research existing simulation tools or frameworks that can be adapted for our purpose. This will guide us in either modifying an existing model or developing a new one tailored to our needs.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there's a need to generate data that can inform decision-making or hypothesis testing, potentially due to gaps in current data or insights. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing primarily on data generation rather than considering the broader implications and applications of simulations as tools for strategic insight and problem-solving. By stepping back, I can ensure that the simulations are aligned with larger goals and not just immediate data needs."
