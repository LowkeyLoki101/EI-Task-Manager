  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a pattern of recurring issues or opportunities that others overlook due to their focus on immediate tasks or conventional thinking. This could involve noticing inefficiencies in a process, identifying unmet needs in a market, or recognizing emerging trends before they become mainstream. Clearly articulating and documenting these observations can help in addressing the problem or capitalizing on the opportunity.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern you're noticing isn't about inefficiencies or unmet needs, but rather about the communication gaps or cultural dynamics within your team or organization? From this perspective, the recurring issues may stem from misunderstandings or unspoken assumptions that hinder collaboration and innovation. Shifting focus towards improving communication and fostering a more inclusive environment could lead to unexpected solutions and opportunities.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "How might exploring the root causes of these communication gaps or cultural dynamics lead to deeper insights about organizational behavior? Are there underlying systemic issues, such as leadership styles or decision-making processes, that contribute to these patterns? Investigating these questions could reveal foundational changes needed to enhance collaboration and innovation, prompting a more holistic approach to addressing recurring issues.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring issues I observe are rooted in communication gaps and cultural dynamics within the organization. To address this, I will conduct a series of interviews and workshops with team members to better understand these dynamics and identify specific areas for improvement. This action will help create a more inclusive and collaborative environment, potentially uncovering new solutions and opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern now because it might reveal underlying issues that impede progress or innovation within the organization. This reflects a recurring pattern in my approach: focusing on identifying systemic issues rather than just surface-level symptoms. By consistently looking for deeper causes, I am aiming to facilitate more sustainable and impactful changes."
