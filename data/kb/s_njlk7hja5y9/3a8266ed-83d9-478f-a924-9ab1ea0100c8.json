  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can serve as an intentional strategy to disrupt habitual thought patterns, potentially leading to innovative ideas and solutions. As a next step, I will test this hypothesis by selecting a set of existing prompts, shuffling them, and evaluating the outcomes using predefined criteria for creativity and insight. Based on the results, I will refine the shuffling method to better suit specific contexts, such as creative writing or problem-solving sessions.",
