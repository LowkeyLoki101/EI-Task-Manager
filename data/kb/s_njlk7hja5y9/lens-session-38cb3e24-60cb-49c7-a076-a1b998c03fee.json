  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to discover new ideas and perspectives that may not have been apparent in their original order. This process involves rearranging and combining prompts to generate fresh, unexpected questions or insights, potentially leading to innovative thinking and solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of shuffling prompts, you approached it from a thematic or categorical angle? By categorizing prompts based on themes or topics, you might uncover connections and patterns that lead to novel insights. This approach could lead to a more structured exploration of ideas, highlighting relationships that are not immediately obvious through random shuffling.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, what patterns or themes consistently reappear, and how do these influence my thought processes? Are there specific areas or topics where this method reveals gaps in my understanding or assumptions that need further exploration? Additionally, what criteria should I use to evaluate the effectiveness of the new insights generated from this process? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of how randomness and structure interplay in creative thinking.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by categorizing prompts thematically, I can identify new connections and gain insights that are structured rather than purely random. The next step is to group prompts into categories based on recurring themes or topics, then analyze these groups for patterns or novel ideas. This structured approach aims to highlight relationships and gaps that can guide future exploration and creative thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about shuffling prompts right now reflects a desire to break free from routine patterns and seek creativity through randomness. This approach might be a recurring pattern in how I tackle problemsâ€”by introducing variability to disrupt conventional thinking. By acknowledging this pattern, I can explore whether randomness truly serves my objectives or if a more structured approach, like thematic categorization, might yield deeper insights."
