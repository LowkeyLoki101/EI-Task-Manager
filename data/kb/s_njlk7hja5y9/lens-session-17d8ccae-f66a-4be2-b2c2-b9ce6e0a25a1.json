  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could change my perspective or approach in a given situation. I need to focus on areas where assumptions might be challenged or where there is potential for uncovering new, overlooked information. This involves being open to exploring aspects that are typically taken for granted or not thoroughly examined.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from a different perspective, consider the angle of personal growth and self-awareness. Instead of focusing solely on external surprises or insights, think about what internal realizations or assumptions about yourself might surprise you if uncovered. This approach shifts the focus to introspection, encouraging you to explore biases or beliefs that you might not have questioned before, which could lead to profound personal insights and transformative change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What are the underlying assumptions or beliefs that shape my current understanding, and how might they be challenged by unexpected discoveries? Additionally, what areas of my personal or professional life have I neglected to question deeply, and how could exploring these areas lead to surprising insights? These inquiries warrant deeper research or introspection to identify and challenge entrenched patterns or beliefs, potentially leading to transformative insights and growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries could emerge from challenging deeply held assumptions or exploring neglected areas of personal growth. As a next step, I will dedicate time to introspective reflection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to identify these assumptions and neglected areas. This will enable me to uncover insights that could lead to personal and professional growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking to challenge my current assumptions and uncover hidden insights that could lead to personal and professional growth. The pattern I might be repeating is a tendency to focus on external discoveries rather than introspective insights. By applying a meta-lens, I aim to balance external exploration with internal reflection, ensuring that I am open to surprising realizations both in the world around me and within myself."
