  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is that you are noticing a recurring pattern that others seem to overlook. This could be due to differences in perspective, experience, or awareness. Clearly identifying and articulating this pattern could help bridge the gap in understanding and potentially lead to valuable insights or solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the recurring pattern you're noticing is actually a signal that you're interpreting based on your unique experiences, and others aren't missing it but interpreting it differently based on their own backgrounds? By viewing it from this angle, the goal shifts from trying to get others to see the same pattern to understanding how different perspectives might contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the situation. This could lead to more collaborative discussions where each person's interpretation is valued as part of a larger puzzle.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, you might explore questions such as: What underlying assumptions are influencing how you and others perceive this pattern differently? Are there cognitive biases at play that need to be addressed? Additionally, investigating how similar patterns have been understood or misunderstood in different contexts could provide deeper insights. It would also be valuable to research how diverse perspectives can be harnessed to create a more comprehensive understanding of the recurring pattern you're noticing.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring pattern I'm noticing might be interpreted differently by others due to varying perspectives and experiences. As a next step, I will engage in a collaborative discussion with colleagues or peers to share my observations and invite them to share their interpretations. This approach aims to combine our insights and reach a more comprehensive understanding of the pattern.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because it seems to recur in various situations, prompting a reflection on my unique perspective and its alignment with others'. This could be a repeated pattern of seeking validation or understanding, indicating a need to better communicate my insights or to explore how different interpretations can coexist and enrich collective understanding. By examining this, I can identify if my approach tends to prioritize my interpretation over others', and adjust to encourage more inclusive and collaborative discussions."
