  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a question that has been neglected or overlooked in my self-reflection process. This requires recognizing areas of my life or thoughts that I haven't recently examined or questioned. By framing it this way, I can direct my focus towards uncovering potentially important insights or issues that need attention.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on questions I've neglected, I could approach this from the angle of exploring new territories of thought or experience that I have yet to consider. This shift in perspective encourages me to look forward rather than backward, prompting me to explore novel areas that could lead to personal growth or new insights. By framing it this way, I open myself up to questions that are not just forgotten, but entirely unexplored.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this trigger, new questions arise such as: What are the potential areas of my life that have evolved or changed recently, and how might that affect the questions I should be asking myself? Additionally, how can I systematically explore and uncover these areas to ensure comprehensive personal development? These questions suggest a need for deeper research into self-reflection techniques or tools that can help identify and address neglected areas of inquiry, as well as exploration into emerging life patterns or changes that merit new questions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are areas of my life, particularly those that have recently changed or evolved, where I haven't fully explored new questions. As a next step, I'll allocate time to reflect on recent life changes, perhaps using journaling or a mind map, to identify these areas and formulate specific questions that could lead to deeper understanding and growth. This will help ensure I'm continually addressing both overlooked and unexplored aspects of my life.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question because it signals a need for deeper self-reflection and the avoidance of complacency in my personal growth journey. This pattern of seeking out overlooked questions suggests a recurring theme in how I approach self-awareness: I tend to periodically audit my thoughts to ensure I'm not missing critical insights. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously decide whether this approach continues to serve my growth effectively or if it's time to adopt a new strategy for self-inquiry."
