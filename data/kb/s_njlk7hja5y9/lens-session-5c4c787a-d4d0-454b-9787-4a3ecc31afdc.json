  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue that causes discomfort or anxiety, and thus, I subconsciously push it aside. It could relate to personal life, work, or health, where addressing it requires effort, confrontation, or change that I am not ready to face. Recognizing this avoidance is the first step toward addressing and resolving the issue.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't as daunting as I perceive it to be, but rather an opportunity for growth and learning? Instead of viewing it as a source of anxiety, I could reframe it as a chance to develop new skills or improve my situation. By changing my perspective, I might find the courage and motivation to tackle it head-on, potentially leading to positive outcomes I hadn't considered before.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the problem I'm avoiding, I can ask: What specific fears or beliefs are contributing to my avoidance? Could there be underlying patterns or past experiences that make this issue particularly challenging for me? Investigating these questions might uncover deeper insights into my behavior, revealing opportunities for personal growth and healing that extend beyond just this immediate problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is tied to a fear of change or confrontation, but it also presents an opportunity for personal growth. As a next step, I will set aside specific time to reflect on this issue, perhaps by journaling or discussing it with a trusted friend, which could help me gain clarity and develop a plan to address it constructively.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I realize I'm thinking about avoidance because it's a recurring pattern where I shy away from confronting uncomfortable truths or challenges. This avoidance cycle might stem from a fear of failure or negative outcomes. Recognizing this pattern allows me to understand the underlying reasons for my avoidance, enabling me to develop strategies to break this habit and approach problems more proactively."
