  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to generate fresh ideas and perspectives by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling these prompts, I can uncover new combinations and insights, potentially leading to innovative solutions or creative outputs that were not initially apparent. This process invites exploration and experimentation with my own thought patterns.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the potential outcomes of shuffling prompts, consider how the process itself can serve as a tool for self-discovery and reflection. By rearranging your prompts, you might reveal underlying themes or patterns in your thinking that were previously unnoticed. This perspective shifts the emphasis from the end results to the insights gained through the act of shuffling itself, inviting a deeper understanding of your cognitive processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively exploring the concept of shuffling prompts, we can ask how this practice might be applied to other areas of thinking or problem-solving, such as brainstorming or decision-making. What methodologies from other fields, like combinatorial creativity in art or iterative design in engineering, could enhance or inform the process of prompt shuffling? Additionally, what tools or technologies could facilitate this exploration, and how might the results be systematically analyzed to reveal deeper patterns or insights in our cognitive processes?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my prompts will uncover new insights and patterns in my thinking, leading to creative solutions I hadn't considered. As a next step, I'll experiment with rearranging my existing prompts and document any new ideas or themes that emerge. I'll also explore tools or software that can facilitate this shuffling process to systematically analyze the outcomes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts now because I'm seeking to break free from habitual thought patterns and explore new avenues of creativity. This reflects a recurring pattern in my approach where I actively seek methods to disrupt conventional thinking and challenge my cognitive routines. By applying this meta-lens, I recognize my tendency to pursue novelty and spontaneity as a way to foster growth and innovation in my thought processes."
