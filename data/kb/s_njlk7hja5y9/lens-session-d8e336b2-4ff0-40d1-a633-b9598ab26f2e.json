  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as identifying unexpected findings or outcomes that challenge my current assumptions or beliefs. This involves questioning what I assume to be true and exploring areas where my knowledge is limited or where I've not yet considered alternative possibilities. The goal is to uncover blind spots or overlooked opportunities by deliberately seeking out surprises or contradictions in my understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "From another angle, I could view this problem as an opportunity to discover novelty in familiar situations. Instead of focusing solely on contradictions or surprises in my assumptions, I could explore what new insights or innovative ideas could emerge if I approached every situation with curiosity and openness. This shift from seeking surprises to embracing potential novelty encourages me to consider how even small, unexpected details in routine contexts can lead to breakthroughs or creative solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" raises questions about the nature of surprise itself and what factors contribute to our capacity to be surprised. It prompts deeper investigation into how cognitive biases and preconceived notions shape our expectations, and how actively seeking diverse perspectives might alter what we consider surprising. Additionally, it encourages exploring methodologies for systematically identifying and embracing the unforeseen in various fields, potentially leading to innovative discoveries or personal growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by actively seeking out areas where I have limited knowledge or strong assumptions, I can uncover surprising insights that challenge my current perspective. As a next step, I will engage in conversations with individuals from diverse backgrounds and explore resources outside my typical realm of interest to identify unexpected information or viewpoints. This approach will help me systematically broaden my understanding and embrace potential surprises.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying surprises because it challenges my habitual way of processing information, which often involves relying on established patterns and assumptions. This approach highlights a recurring pattern in my thinking where I may overlook the unexpected due to familiarity or complacency. By using a meta-lens, I'm intentionally questioning my cognitive biases and encouraging a mindset that values curiosity and exploration, which can lead to more innovative and adaptive thinking."
