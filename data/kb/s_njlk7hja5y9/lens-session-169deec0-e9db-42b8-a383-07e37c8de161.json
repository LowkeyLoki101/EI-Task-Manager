  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of my current assumptions, particularly those that might not align with reality. By identifying and challenging these assumptions, I can uncover potential blind spots or errors in my reasoning that could be affecting my decisions or actions. This requires a critical examination of my beliefs and the evidence or lack thereof that supports them.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on questioning my assumptions, I could reframe the situation by considering what assumptions others might be making and how they influence their perspectives and actions. This shift in perspective encourages empathy and a broader understanding of the context, potentially leading to more collaborative and informed decision-making. By understanding diverse viewpoints, I might uncover assumptions that are universally flawed or discover new insights that challenge my initial beliefs.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Considering the question \"What assumption am I making that might be wrong?\" leads to further inquiries, such as: What are the underlying reasons or biases that led me to form these assumptions in the first place? How do these assumptions affect my interactions and decisions in different contexts? Investigating these new questions could involve deeper research into cognitive biases and exploring tools for identifying and addressing these biases, such as reflective journaling or seeking feedback from diverse perspectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or limited perspectives. As a next step, I will engage in reflective journaling to systematically explore these assumptions and seek feedback from a diverse group of peers to gain different viewpoints. This approach will help me identify any flawed assumptions and broaden my understanding of the situation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about questioning my assumptions right now to improve my decision-making and avoid potential biases that could lead to errors. This pattern of introspection reflects a commitment to continuous learning and growth, where I regularly scrutinize my beliefs to align them more closely with reality. By consistently applying this approach, I aim to foster a mindset that is adaptable and open to new information, ultimately enhancing my understanding and interactions with the world."
