  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves generating novel ideas by rearranging existing prompts. The goal is to explore whether shuffling these prompts can lead to unexpected and innovative questions or concepts that may not have been considered in their original order. This approach seeks to stimulate creativity and fresh perspectives by breaking conventional thought patterns.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on shuffling prompts to generate new ideas, you approached it as a collaborative exercise with others? By inviting different perspectives and interpretations, you might uncover innovative prompts that blend diverse viewpoints, leading to richer and more varied outcomes than what individual shuffling could achieve alone. This perspective emphasizes the power of collective creativity over solitary brainstorming.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to determine the effectiveness of shuffled prompts in generating innovative ideas? Additionally, what role might digital tools or algorithms play in optimizing the shuffling process for maximum creativity? Exploring these questions could lead to the development of new methodologies or tools that enhance ideation through strategic prompt manipulation.",
  "closureStep": "The next step is to experiment with both individual and collaborative prompt shuffling to observe the diversity of ideas generated. I will also investigate digital tools that facilitate prompt manipulation and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing creativity. This approach will help refine the methodology and establish criteria for successful prompt innovation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm seeking to break out of routine thought patterns and explore new possibilities by rearranging familiar elements. This approach reflects a recurring pattern in my problem-solving strategy: using structured randomness to stimulate creativity. By recognizing this pattern, I can intentionally incorporate other creativity-enhancing techniques, like collaboration, to further diversify the ideas generated from shuffling prompts."
