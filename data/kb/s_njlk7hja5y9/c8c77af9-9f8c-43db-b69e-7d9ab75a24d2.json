  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that reverse-engineering problems in the energy sector using data simulations can reveal hidden opportunities for integrating AI and IoT, along with insights into emerging consumer behavior and decentralized energy systems. The next step is to conduct a series of data simulations focusing on these areas, aiming to identify both inefficiencies and innovation opportunities. This will involve collaborating with industry experts to validate findings and explore the feasibility of implementing new technologies and business models.",
