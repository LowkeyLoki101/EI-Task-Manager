  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that assumptions often go unchallenged due to cognitive biases and lack of a structured approach to questioning them. As a next step, I will explore and implement a framework like root cause analysis to systematically identify and evaluate assumptions in various contexts. Additionally, I'll educate myself on common cognitive biases to better recognize when they might be influencing my assumptions.",
