  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a particular situation is correct without considering alternative perspectives or additional information. This assumption might limit my ability to make informed decisions or adapt to new evidence. By questioning this assumption, I can open myself up to new insights and potentially uncover more effective solutions or understandings.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the assumption from another perspective, consider the possibility that holding onto the current belief might actually provide some temporary comfort or stability, even if it's not entirely accurate. By recognizing this, you can actively seek out and embrace uncertainty as an opportunity for growth, rather than solely focusing on the correctness of your assumption. This shift can lead to adopting a more flexible mindset that values the process of exploration and learning over the need for immediate certainty.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger, \"What assumption am I making that might be wrong?\" leads to further questioning: What are the underlying beliefs or biases that have shaped this assumption? How have past experiences influenced my current thinking, and in what ways might they continue to do so unknowingly? Delving deeper into these questions can reveal patterns in my decision-making process and highlight areas where I might benefit from challenging my long-standing beliefs or habits.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumption might stem from long-standing biases or past experiences that I've yet to fully examine. The next step is to actively seek out diverse perspectives and new information to challenge and refine my current beliefs. I will make it a point to engage in discussions with people who have differing viewpoints and reflect on how these interactions influence my understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this assumption right now because it reflects a broader pattern of seeking certainty and validation in my understanding, which may limit my openness to new perspectives and adaptability. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously work on cultivating a mindset that values curiosity and continuous learning, allowing me to embrace uncertainty as a natural and beneficial part of the decision-making process."
