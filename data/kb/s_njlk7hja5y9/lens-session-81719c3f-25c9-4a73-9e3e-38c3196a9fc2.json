  "frameStep": "The problem is about exploring creativity and generating new ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling prompts, one can discover unexpected combinations and fresh perspectives, potentially leading to innovative solutions or insights. The goal is to break out of routine thinking patterns and see what new questions or ideas might surface.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on shuffling prompts, you approached this from the perspective of collaboration? By sharing your prompts with others and inviting them to shuffle and respond, you could gain insights from diverse perspectives and foster a creative exchange. This angle emphasizes the power of collective creativity and how external input can lead to unexpected and enriching outcomes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling your prompts, what patterns or themes consistently reappear, and how do they inform your core interests or concerns? Additionally, what tools or methods could be developed to automate or enhance the shuffling process, making it more efficient and revealing more nuanced insights? Exploring these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of your creative process and potentially uncover new approaches to idea generation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can reveal underlying themes and patterns in my thinking, offering a fresh lens for idea generation. The next step is to create a collaborative experiment by inviting others to shuffle and engage with my prompts, potentially using a digital tool to automate this process. This will facilitate diverse input and could lead to innovative insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "In considering why I'm focusing on shuffling my own prompts, it seems I am seeking novel ways to stimulate my creativity and break free from habitual thinking patterns. This approach may reflect a broader pattern in my thinking where I rely on self-contained methods for innovation. By recognizing this, I can aim to incorporate more external influences and collaborative elements into my process, potentially leading to richer and more varied insights."
