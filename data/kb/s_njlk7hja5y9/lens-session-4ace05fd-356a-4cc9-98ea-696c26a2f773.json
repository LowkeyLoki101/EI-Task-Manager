  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring a different perspective by reversing the usual approach. Framing this, I see an opportunity to identify assumptions and steps that might be overlooked in the conventional method. By starting with the desired outcome and working backwards, I can uncover hidden dependencies and alternative solutions that might otherwise remain hidden. This approach is especially useful in problem-solving scenarios where traditional methods have not yielded successful results.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this problem from the perspective of reverse engineering could reveal insights into the inefficiencies or gaps in the current approach. By deconstructing the problem from the end goal to the starting point, we might identify critical steps that are often taken for granted or overlooked. This perspective shift could illuminate alternative pathways or innovative solutions that are not apparent when approaching the problem from a traditional, forward-thinking angle.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, we can ask new questions such as: What assumptions are embedded in the conventional method that might be challenged? Are there critical steps that are typically skipped or underestimated in the forward approach? Furthermore, deeper investigation could involve researching successful case studies where reverse engineering led to breakthroughs, or exploring fields like design thinking, where reverse problem-solving has been effectively applied. This could uncover methodologies and tools that facilitate a backward approach, offering a structured way to innovate and solve complex problems.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify overlooked assumptions and critical steps, potentially leading to innovative solutions. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and systematically trace back to the starting point, documenting any insights or discrepancies along the way. I will also research methodologies like reverse engineering and design thinking to find structured approaches that support this backward analysis.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because it challenges the conventional methods I've been using, which may not have been effective. This reflects a pattern of seeking alternative strategies when traditional approaches fail, highlighting a tendency to question assumptions and explore different angles for problem-solving. This meta-awareness could help refine my process by incorporating diverse perspectives and fostering innovation."
