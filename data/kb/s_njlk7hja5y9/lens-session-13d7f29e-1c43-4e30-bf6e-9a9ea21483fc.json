  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring how the rearrangement of existing prompts can lead to the creation of new, potentially insightful prompts. The idea is to identify the potential for novel questions or perspectives that can arise from combining and modifying the components of the original prompts. This process could reveal gaps in thinking or introduce innovative ways to approach familiar topics.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on shuffling your own prompts, you consider integrating prompts from diverse sources or disciplines? This could lead to even more varied and unexpected combinations, potentially expanding the scope of inquiry and leading to richer, more interdisciplinary insights. By stepping outside of your usual prompt set, you might uncover novel connections that wouldn't emerge solely from rearranging your existing ideas.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What if you consider the effects of shuffling prompts within specific thematic categories versus across different themes? How might this influence the depth and breadth of new insights? Additionally, what tools or methods could be developed to systematically analyze and optimize the recombination of prompts for generating the most innovative or unexpected outcomes? Exploring these questions could lead to a structured approach for maximizing the creative potential of prompt rearrangements.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that integrating prompts from diverse disciplines and systematically analyzing the recombination of prompts across thematic categories can lead to more innovative insights than simply shuffling my own prompts. The next step is to gather prompts from varied sources, categorize them, and use a tool or method to experiment with their combinations to identify novel connections and insights. This structured approach will help maximize the creative potential of the exercise.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this because I'm seeking new insights and perspectives by reimagining familiar ideas. This pattern of reshuffling known elements to generate novelty reflects a desire for continuous learning and creativity. By examining why I'm attracted to this approach, I can understand my inclination towards innovation and possibly explore more structured methods for idea generation, such as integrating diverse disciplines or methodologies."
