  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is the potential presence of an incorrect assumption affecting decision-making or perceptions. I see a need to identify and challenge assumptions that may be influencing outcomes or perspectives inaccurately. By framing the problem as a quest to uncover these assumptions, it becomes possible to address and correct them for clearer and more effective thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, consider reframing the situation as an opportunity to explore diverse perspectives. By actively seeking input from others and encouraging different viewpoints, you might uncover assumptions you hadn't even considered and foster a more collaborative and comprehensive understanding of the situation. This shift from self-reflection to inclusive dialogue can lead to more innovative solutions and a broader awareness of underlying assumptions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the implications of discovering that an assumption is incorrect? How might challenging this assumption affect related beliefs or decisions? Additionally, what processes or frameworks can be implemented to continuously evaluate and question assumptions in the future, ensuring a dynamic and adaptive approach to understanding and decision-making? Exploring these questions could lead to a robust strategy for regularly reassessing assumptions and enhancing critical thinking.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by fostering an environment of inclusive dialogue and actively seeking diverse perspectives, I can more effectively identify and challenge incorrect assumptions. The next step is to implement regular discussions with a diverse group of stakeholders to explore various viewpoints and assumptions. Additionally, I will establish a routine process for revisiting and questioning assumptions to ensure continuous improvement in decision-making and critical thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions right now because I am aiming to improve decision-making and understanding by challenging any biases or errors in my thought process. The pattern I am repeating is a focus on introspection and self-correction, which, while valuable, might limit my perspective. By recognizing this tendency, I can consciously seek external input and diverse viewpoints to enrich my understanding and avoid the pitfalls of narrow thinking."
