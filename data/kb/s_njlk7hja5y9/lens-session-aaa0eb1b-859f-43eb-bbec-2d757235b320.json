  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience. The goal is to create a narrative that captures attention and connects emotionally or intellectually with potential customers, prompting them to engage with the content. A clear focus should be on understanding current trends, audience preferences, and unique brand elements that can be woven into a captivating story.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing solely on creating a new story hook, you looked at repurposing an existing story from your brand's history or customer experiences? By revisiting and revitalizing past narratives that have already resonated with the audience, you can save time while ensuring authenticity and a proven connection. Additionally, consider flipping the perspectiveâ€”what if you crafted a story hook based on a customer's journey or transformation instead of just highlighting your product or brand?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens further, one might ask: What existing customer stories or brand history elements have previously resonated with the audience, and how can they be reimagined to fit current trends and platforms? Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate emerging storytelling formats, such as interactive or user-generated content, which could offer fresh ways to engage the audience. Finally, consider researching how competitors are utilizing their story hooks successfully, and what unique insights can be drawn from their strategies to inform your own content creation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to create a marketing story hook centered around a compelling customer transformation story, leveraging past successes and reimagining them to align with current trends. The next step is to identify a specific customer experience or brand story that has previously resonated with the audience and explore ways to update it for today's platforms, potentially incorporating interactive or user-generated elements. Additionally, I'll analyze competitor strategies to gain insights for enhancing our narrative approach.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about creating a compelling story hook right now because it is crucial for capturing audience attention and differentiating in a crowded market. A pattern I repeat is focusing on originality and newness, often overlooking the value of revisiting and reimagining existing narratives or customer experiences that have already proven effective. By recognizing this tendency, I can balance the pursuit of innovation with leveraging established stories to create impactful marketing content."
