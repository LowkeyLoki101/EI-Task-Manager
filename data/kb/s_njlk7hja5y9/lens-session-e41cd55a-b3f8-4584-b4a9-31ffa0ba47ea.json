  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could arise in a given situation. What surprises might reveal gaps in knowledge, assumptions, or blind spots that I hadn't considered? Framing this involves recognizing what aspects of my current understanding or environment could be disrupted by new, surprising information.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger, consider approaching it from the perspective of someone entirely different from yourself, such as a colleague, a competitor, or even an outsider with no prior knowledge of your situation. What might surprise them if they discovered it in your context? This shift could highlight biases or overlooked areas in your current thinking that are only apparent when viewed through an unfamiliar lens. It might also reveal opportunities or threats that are invisible from your personal viewpoint, offering new pathways for exploration and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to questions such as: What underlying assumptions are guiding what I consider surprising? How do my cultural, educational, or experiential backgrounds shape these assumptions, and what might I be missing by not questioning them? Additionally, exploring how similar surprises have impacted others in my field could reveal patterns or insights that deserve deeper investigation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often arise from overlooked assumptions or biases in my current understanding. To take action, I'll conduct a thorough review of recent developments in my field and solicit feedback from peers with diverse perspectives to identify any blind spots I might have missed. This approach will help uncover surprising insights and guide future learning or strategic decisions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this trigger now to challenge my current understanding and to identify potential blind spots or gaps in my knowledge. This pattern of thinking is about breaking out of routine perspectives to uncover hidden assumptions and opportunities for growth. By consistently questioning what might surprise me, I aim to cultivate a mindset that is open to innovation and adaptable to unexpected changes."
