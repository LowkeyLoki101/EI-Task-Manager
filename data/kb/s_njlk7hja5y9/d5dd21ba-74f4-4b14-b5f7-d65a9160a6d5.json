  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that exploring unfamiliar domains or fields can yield surprising insights due to their novelty and my lack of prior knowledge. As a next step, I will identify at least one new area of interest outside my current expertise and dedicate time each week to learning about it, noting any unexpected findings or insights that challenge my assumptions. Additionally, I'll reflect on and document any biases that may surface during this exploration to better understand what truly surprises me.",
