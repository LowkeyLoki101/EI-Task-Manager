  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely an issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront, perhaps due to its complexity or emotional impact. It might involve a personal relationship, a career decision, or a financial challenge that I've been putting off addressing. By framing this problem, I can begin to identify the specific aspects that need attention and develop a plan to tackle them step by step.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't just a singular issue but a pattern of avoidance itself? From this angle, the core issue may be how I habitually respond to challenges that make me uncomfortable. By focusing on developing strategies to change my approach to avoidance, I can build resilience and address not only the current problem but also future challenges more effectively.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to this problem reveals additional questions such as: What underlying fears or beliefs are driving my pattern of avoidance? How has this avoidance impacted other areas of my life, both positively and negatively? Exploring these questions could lead to deeper insights into my behaviors and the root causes of avoidance, helping me develop more effective coping mechanisms and decision-making strategies. Further research into cognitive-behavioral techniques or mindfulness practices could also be beneficial in addressing these patterns.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I have a tendency to avoid confronting challenging situations, and this pattern is the core issue rather than any single problem. As a next step, I will schedule time to journal and reflect on specific instances of avoidance, identifying common triggers and underlying fears. Additionally, I will explore cognitive-behavioral techniques to develop strategies for managing these avoidance behaviors more effectively.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this problem right now because it reflects a broader pattern of avoidance in my life, which can hinder personal growth and decision-making. By recognizing this pattern, I can gain insight into my habitual responses to discomfort and uncertainty, allowing me to develop more proactive and constructive ways to face challenges. This meta-awareness not only addresses the immediate issue but also equips me with the tools to handle future problems more effectively."
