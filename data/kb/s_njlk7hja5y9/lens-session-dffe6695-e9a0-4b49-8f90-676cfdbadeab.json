  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm framing is the notion of unexpected discoveries in familiar contexts. Specifically, I'm looking at what elements or information in my environment or routine would catch me off guard if encountered. Identifying these surprises could reveal gaps in my awareness or assumptions about the world around me.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from a different perspective, consider the idea of surprises not just as gaps in awareness but as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of focusing solely on what would surprise you, think about how these surprises could change your perception or understanding of your environment. What if each unexpected discovery is viewed as a catalyst for innovation or creativity in your daily routine? This angle shifts the focus from surprise as a disruption to surprise as a valuable and potentially transformative insight.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to further questions such as: How do unexpected discoveries in familiar contexts influence our emotional and cognitive responses? What mechanisms in our brain process these surprises, and how do they impact our learning and decision-making processes? Exploring these questions could involve deeper research into the neuroscience of surprise and its role in adaptive learning or innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries in familiar contexts serve as significant opportunities for learning and innovation. The next step is to actively seek out or create scenarios that might lead to these surprises, perhaps by changing routines or introducing new variables into familiar settings. This approach will help in identifying and leveraging these surprises for personal or professional growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm drawn to the idea of uncovering the unexpected, which can lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of my environment. The pattern I'm repeating is the tendency to seek out surprises as a way to challenge my assumptions and break routine. By consciously identifying these surprising elements, I'm aiming to use them as tools for innovation and creativity rather than simply viewing them as disruptions."
