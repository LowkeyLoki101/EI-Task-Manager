  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an opportunity to explore a reverse-engineering approach. By starting with the desired outcome and working backwards, I can identify the essential steps and potential obstacles that might not be obvious in a forward approach. This could reveal new insights or simpler pathways to reach the solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of just reverse-engineering the steps, what if I reframe the problem by considering it from the perspective of someone who has already solved it? This approach involves adopting the mindset and strategies of a successful problem-solver, which could provide unique insights or alternative methods that are not immediately apparent. By shifting the focus to understanding their thought process and decisions, I might uncover innovative solutions that differ from the traditional backward analysis.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, I might uncover unexpected dependencies or hidden assumptions that are not apparent when moving forward. This perspective raises questions about the underlying goals and prerequisites for each step, prompting deeper investigation into their necessity and effectiveness. Additionally, it could lead me to explore alternative outcomes or solutions that I hadn't initially considered, expanding the scope of potential strategies to solve the problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify key steps and potential obstacles that are not immediately apparent in a forward approach. The next step will be to outline the desired outcome and then map out the steps leading back to the present situation, paying close attention to any dependencies or assumptions that emerge. This backward mapping will help highlight alternative pathways or innovative solutions, which can then be evaluated for feasibility and effectiveness.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I'm interested in exploring alternative strategies to problem-solving that might yield new insights. This pattern of questioning aligns with my tendency to challenge conventional methods and seek innovative solutions, often by adopting different perspectives or methods. By doing so, I aim to break out of habitual thinking patterns and potentially discover more efficient or creative pathways to address challenges."
