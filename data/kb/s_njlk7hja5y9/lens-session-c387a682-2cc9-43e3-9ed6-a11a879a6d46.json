  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the need to identify the assumptions underlying my current beliefs or decisions, as they might be flawed or unfounded. The problem is recognizing and challenging these assumptions to prevent potential errors in judgment, which requires a clear and honest assessment of my thought processes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially wrong assumptions, consider approaching this from a perspective of curiosity and exploration. Ask yourself, \"What new perspectives can I explore that might challenge my current assumptions?\" This shift encourages a mindset open to discovery and learning, rather than just error correction, which can lead to more innovative and comprehensive insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively, consider diving deeper into specific areas where assumptions frequently go unchecked, such as in communication, decision-making, or problem-solving processes. What assumptions do I hold about how others perceive my decisions or actions? Additionally, how do these assumptions influence my relationships and outcomes? This might lead to investigating methods for validating assumptions through feedback or testing in real-world scenarios.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by actively seeking out and exploring new perspectives, I can uncover and challenge hidden assumptions that may be influencing my decisions. The next step is to engage in discussions with diverse groups and seek feedback to test these assumptions in real-world contexts. This approach will help validate or refine my beliefs and lead to more informed and effective decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying potentially wrong assumptions right now because I have a recurring pattern of seeking certainty and correctness in my decision-making processes. This pattern often leads me to focus on error correction rather than embracing uncertainty and exploration. By recognizing this tendency, I can shift my approach to be more open to new perspectives and learning opportunities, fostering a more adaptive and innovative mindset."
