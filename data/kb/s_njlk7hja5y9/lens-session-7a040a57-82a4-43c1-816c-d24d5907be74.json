  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a unique and overlooked pattern in solar technology that can serve as a captivating story hook. This involves discovering a trend or anomaly in how solar technology is developing or being implemented that has not been widely recognized or reported, offering fresh insights or perspectives that can engage and intrigue an audience.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached this from the perspective of the cultural or social impact of solar technology rather than just the technological or market trends? By exploring how solar technology is transforming communities, especially in underserved areas, we might uncover a pattern of empowerment and innovation that isn't widely discussed. This reframes the story from a purely technical angle to one that highlights human stories and societal shifts, offering a rich and engaging narrative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of cultural or social impact, new questions emerge: How are communities adapting to and reshaping their identities through solar technology? What are the long-term societal changes driven by the proliferation of solar energy in traditionally fossil-fuel-dependent regions? Investigating these questions could reveal deeper narratives about resilience, adaptation, and cultural shifts, warranting further research into case studies of specific communities undergoing these transformations.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that solar technology is not only an environmental and economic shift but also a catalyst for cultural and social transformation in underserved communities. The next step is to conduct research into specific communities globally where solar technology has significantly altered societal structures, livelihoods, or cultural narratives. I will focus on gathering case studies and firsthand accounts to uncover these unique stories of transformation and resilience, which could serve as the foundation for a compelling narrative.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I am seeking to create a compelling narrative that stands out in a crowded field of solar technology stories. This reflects a pattern of aiming to uncover hidden layers or angles in a topic to provide fresh and engaging content. By focusing on the social and cultural impacts of solar technology, I am attempting to break away from traditional technological narratives and explore the broader implications on human experiences and societal change. This approach also highlights a consistent pattern in my work of valuing stories that connect technology with its real-world impact on people's lives."
