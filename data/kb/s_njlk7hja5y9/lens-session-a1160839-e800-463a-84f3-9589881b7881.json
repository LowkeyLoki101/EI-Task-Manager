  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem-solving approach that involves starting from the desired outcome and working backward to identify the steps needed to achieve it. This reverse-engineering method can help clarify the process by highlighting necessary actions and potential obstacles that might not be apparent when approaching the problem in a traditional, forward manner. It encourages a clear focus on the end goal and can reveal alternative pathways or solutions that wouldn't be considered otherwise.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of starting with the outcome, we began by imagining the worst-case scenario or potential failures and worked backward to mitigate them? This approach not only identifies critical pitfalls early on but also builds a robust solution by preemptively addressing vulnerabilities. By reframing the problem-solving process to focus on potential failures, we can ensure a more resilient and comprehensive plan.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens to approaching a problem backwards, we can ask: How can reverse-engineering be further refined? What methodologies exist for systematically identifying and addressing potential failures from the end back to the start? Additionally, exploring the psychological effects this reversal has on problem-solving creativity and innovation could provide insights into optimizing decision-making processes. Further research could delve into case studies where backward problem-solving led to unexpected, successful outcomes, highlighting patterns or strategies that can be generalized.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can uncover unique insights and potential solutions that are not immediately apparent when moving forward. The next step is to apply this reverse-engineering approach to a current project by defining the desired outcome, identifying possible obstacles, and mapping out the required steps in reverse order. I will also document any unexpected insights or alternative strategies that emerge during this process to refine my approach further.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because it challenges my usual problem-solving patterns, which typically focus on linear progression from start to finish. This is part of a broader pattern where I seek innovative strategies by questioning conventional methods, aiming to uncover insights that may be missed by following traditional approaches. By doing this, I aim to disrupt my habitual thinking processes, encouraging creativity and thoroughness in addressing complex issues."
