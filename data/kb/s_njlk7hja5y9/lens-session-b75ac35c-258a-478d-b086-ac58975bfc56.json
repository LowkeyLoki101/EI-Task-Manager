  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as identifying a suitable simulation that can generate relevant and useful data for our specific needs. The goal is to design a simulation model that accurately reflects the scenarios or conditions we want to explore, enabling us to gather new insights or validate hypotheses. It involves determining the parameters, variables, and potential outcomes that align with our objectives.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on creating a new simulation, we consider leveraging existing simulations or datasets and adapting them to our needs? This approach might save time and resources while still providing valuable insights. Alternatively, we could explore collaborative opportunities with other teams or organizations that have expertise in simulation development, allowing us to access a broader range of data and perspectives.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific areas or phenomena are we aiming to simulate, and how might this focus guide our choice of simulation model or existing datasets to adapt? Are there emerging simulation technologies or methodologies that we could explore to enhance the accuracy or scope of our data collection? Additionally, how can we evaluate the potential impact of these simulations on our decision-making processes or strategic goals, ensuring that the data generated aligns with our objectives?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to first conduct a thorough review of existing simulation models and datasets that align with our objectives, to determine if they can be effectively adapted for our needs. The next step is to identify specific parameters and variables that are crucial for our focus area, and then evaluate potential partnerships with experts or teams who have experience in those simulations. This approach will guide us in either adapting an existing model or designing a new simulation framework that efficiently generates the data we need.",

  "meta_lensStep": "In thinking about creating a new simulation, I'm likely driven by a pattern of seeking direct control over the data generation process to ensure it aligns precisely with our objectives. This approach may stem from a tendency to favor building custom solutions rather than adapting existing resources. By recognizing this pattern, I can consider whether it is always necessary to create something entirely new or if leveraging existing tools could be more efficient and equally effective."
