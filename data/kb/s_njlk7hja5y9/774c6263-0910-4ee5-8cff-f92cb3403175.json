  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that procrastination signals a misalignment between certain tasks and my interests or values. The next step is to systematically identify these tasks and evaluate why they may not resonate with me. I will take action by setting aside dedicated time this week to analyze my current to-do list, reassess each task's alignment with my goals, and adjust priorities or approaches to better match my motivations.",
