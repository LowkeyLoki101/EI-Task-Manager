  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by reverse-engineering the problem, I can uncover hidden dependencies or assumptions that were missed in the forward approach. The next step will be to outline the desired outcome and systematically trace back the steps needed to achieve it, identifying any alternative pathways or critical factors that come to light. I will then apply these insights to test whether they improve the efficiency or effectiveness of my problem-solving strategy.",
