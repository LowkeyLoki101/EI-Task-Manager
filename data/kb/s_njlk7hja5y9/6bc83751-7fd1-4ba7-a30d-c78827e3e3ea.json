  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to design a simulation focused on underexplored scenarios or variables that are critical to our field, such as those that involve dynamic interactions or complex systems. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive review of existing data and simulation models to identify gaps and opportunities for enhancement. I will then develop a detailed simulation plan that outlines the objectives, parameters, and methodologies to ensure the generation of meaningful and actionable new data.",
