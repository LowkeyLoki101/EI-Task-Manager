  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is that I am noticing a recurring pattern that others seem to overlook. This could be a unique insight or trend that stands out to me but is not apparent to others, possibly due to differences in perspective, experience, or focus. Identifying and clearly articulating this pattern could provide value or a competitive advantage.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I'm noticing isn't actually being overlooked by others, but rather isn't being communicated effectively or given enough attention? Perhaps the issue lies in how the pattern is being presented or prioritized, rather than its recognition. By shifting focus to improving communication or creating compelling narratives around the pattern, I could help others see its significance and encourage them to engage with it more deeply.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What other underlying factors might influence why this pattern is overlooked by others, such as cognitive biases, industry norms, or the availability of data? How can I further investigate the impact of these factors on perception and recognition of the pattern? Additionally, could there be other related patterns or trends that emerge when examining this from different angles, and how might these intersect with or enhance the original insight?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern is being overlooked due to a combination of ineffective communication and cognitive biases that obscure its importance. As a next step, I will focus on crafting a clear, compelling narrative that highlights the significance of the pattern and addresses potential biases. This could involve gathering relevant data, creating visual aids, or presenting case studies that demonstrate the pattern's impact, thereby encouraging others to recognize and engage with it more actively.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I have a strong desire to leverage my unique perspective to add value, possibly driven by a need to feel validated or recognized for my insights. This might be a recurring pattern where I focus intensely on differences in perception, aiming to bridge gaps in understanding, but perhaps I also need to examine if I consistently assume others are missing what I see, rather than exploring collaborative ways to confirm and build upon shared observations."
