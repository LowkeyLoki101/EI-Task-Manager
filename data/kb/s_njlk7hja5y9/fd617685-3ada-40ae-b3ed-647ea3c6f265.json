  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from areas where my assumptions remain unchallenged. Therefore, my next step is to actively seek out and question these assumptions, especially in areas where I feel most confident or certain. This could involve engaging with diverse perspectives, reading materials outside my usual interests, or reflecting on recent experiences to identify moments of unexpected reactions. By doing so, I aim to better understand my biases and cultivate a more open mindset towards unexpected discoveries.",
