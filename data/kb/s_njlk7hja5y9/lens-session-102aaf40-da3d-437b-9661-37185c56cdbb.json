  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a novel and overlooked pattern in solar technology that can serve as a compelling story hook. This involves examining emerging trends, technological advancements, or unexpected applications of solar technology that have not been widely recognized or discussed. The goal is to uncover a fresh perspective or insight that can engage and inform an audience.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the trigger by considering the socio-economic impacts of solar technology: What if instead of focusing solely on technological advancements, you explored a unique story hook around how solar technology is being used in unexpected ways to transform communities or economies in underserved regions? Shifting the perspective from technology to its human impact could uncover compelling narratives about innovation driving social change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of recursive exploration, several new questions arise: How are communities adapting to solar technology in ways that defy conventional expectations? What unexpected partnerships or collaborations are forming between solar technology companies and other industries or sectors? Additionally, diving deeper into the socio-economic impacts, what innovative financing models are emerging to make solar technology accessible to underserved populations, and how might these models be replicable in other sectors or regions? These questions warrant deeper investigation to uncover unique narratives that highlight the broader implications and transformative potential of solar technology.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in exploring the intersection of solar technology with socio-economic transformations in underserved regions. The next step is to conduct research and interviews with communities that have adopted solar technology in unexpected ways, as well as with organizations facilitating innovative financing models. This will help uncover narratives that highlight the human impact and transformative potential of solar energy, offering a fresh perspective for the story.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I am thinking about this now to challenge conventional narratives around solar technology and to identify untapped opportunities for storytelling. This pattern of seeking out less explored angles reflects a broader approach of valuing innovation and novelty in storytelling, aiming to captivate audiences with fresh and impactful insights. In doing so, I am reaffirming the importance of storytelling that not only informs but also inspires change by highlighting the intersection of technology and human experience."
