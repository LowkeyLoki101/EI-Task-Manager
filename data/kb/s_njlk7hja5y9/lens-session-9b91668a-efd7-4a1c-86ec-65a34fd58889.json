  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see that the problem I'm avoiding is acknowledging and addressing a specific issue or challenge in my life that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable. This might be something that requires a difficult conversation, a change in routine, or facing a fear. I need to identify what exactly this issue is and why I am hesitant to confront it.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of seeing this as a problem I'm avoiding, I view it as an opportunity for growth or learning? By reframing it this way, I can approach the issue with curiosity rather than dread, focusing on the potential positive outcomes of facing it head-on. This shift in perspective might make it easier to take the first step, transforming avoidance into proactive engagement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, I should ask what specific fears or beliefs are underpinning my avoidance of this problem. Are there past experiences or patterns that repeatedly lead me to avoid similar challenges? Additionally, exploring what resources or support systems could assist me in confronting this issue might reveal actionable steps to break the cycle of avoidance.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a fear of failure or rejection, possibly stemming from past experiences. My next step is to concretely identify this issue by journaling about my avoidance patterns and seeking feedback from a trusted friend or mentor. I'll also outline a small, manageable action I can take this week to begin addressing the issue, such as scheduling that difficult conversation or researching resources that can support me.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it's a recurring pattern where I tend to sidestep issues that seem daunting or require confronting uncomfortable truths. This pattern often involves procrastination or distraction as coping mechanisms, leading to temporary relief but longer-term stress. By recognizing this tendency, I can focus on developing healthier strategies to face these challenges directly, breaking the cycle of avoidance."
