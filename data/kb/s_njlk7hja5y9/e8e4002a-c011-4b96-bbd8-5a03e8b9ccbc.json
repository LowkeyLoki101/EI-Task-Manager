  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by focusing on both emerging external trends and internal innovations, I can position my business to not only adapt but also lead industry changes. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential disruptive technologies and regulatory changes, while simultaneously brainstorming with my team to identify internal processes and customer engagement strategies that can be enhanced.
