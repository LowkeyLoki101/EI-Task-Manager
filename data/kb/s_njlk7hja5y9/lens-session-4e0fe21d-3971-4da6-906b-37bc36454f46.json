  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring the potential for generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. The focus is on discovering new perspectives or questions that might not have been considered in their original order. This approach seeks to unlock novel ways of thinking by altering the sequence of prompts to stimulate fresh thought patterns or discussions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on the order of prompts, we considered the context or medium in which these prompts are presented? By changing the environment or the format—such as from text to visual or auditory—we might uncover entirely new interpretations or connections, revealing insights that are less about sequence and more about the medium's influence on understanding. This shift might highlight the role that context plays in shaping our responses and creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?\" prompts further exploration into how the reshuffling process itself might be systematized or refined for better results. This raises questions such as: What criteria should guide the reshuffling to maximize creativity? How do different sequences affect our cognitive processes and creativity over time? Additionally, it invites deeper investigation into the role of randomness in creativity and whether certain patterns emerge consistently from such exercises.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by experimenting with both the sequence and context of prompts, I can unlock new creative pathways and insights. The next step is to systematically shuffle my prompts and present them in different formats—such as visual or auditory—to observe any novel patterns or ideas that emerge. This process will involve documenting the results and analyzing any consistent themes or insights that arise from these variations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because I'm seeking fresh perspectives and creative breakthroughs, possibly driven by a desire to break free from routine thought patterns. This approach might reflect a recurring pattern in how I approach problems—valuing innovation and novelty, and often looking for ways to disrupt conventional methods to foster new ideas. By examining this tendency, I can better understand my inclination towards change and adaptability in problem-solving."
