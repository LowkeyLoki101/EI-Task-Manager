  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the persistent pattern of overlooked inefficiencies is deeply tied to organizational culture and individual resistance to change. As a next step, I plan to conduct a survey or hold focus group discussions to gather insights into employees' perceptions of change and innovation within the organization. This will help identify specific cultural or cognitive barriers and inform strategies to create a more open environment for improvement and innovation.",
