  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential for generating new and innovative prompts by rearranging existing ones. This involves analyzing current prompts, shuffling their components, and observing the novel combinations that arise. The goal is to discover fresh perspectives or questions that may lead to unexpected insights or creative outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on the prompts themselves, you considered the context or purpose behind each one? By examining the underlying themes or intentions, you might discover new directions or areas of inquiry when the prompts are shuffled. This shift in perspective could lead to unearthing deeper insights or creating more tailored and meaningful prompts.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to evaluate the effectiveness or creativity of the new prompts that emerge from shuffling? Additionally, how might the process of shuffling prompts be automated or augmented with AI to generate a wider array of innovative ideas? Exploring these questions could lead to deeper insights into the mechanisms of creativity and the development of tools that facilitate ideation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling existing prompts and considering their underlying themes, I can generate novel prompts that lead to fresh insights and creative ideas. The next step is to manually shuffle a set of my prompts, paying attention to their original contexts and purposes, and then evaluate the new combinations based on criteria such as originality and relevance. Additionally, exploring automated tools or AI assistance for this shuffling process could further enhance the diversity and creativity of the prompts generated.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I am seeking novelty and innovation in my approach, possibly driven by a desire to break out of routine thinking patterns. This reflects a pattern of seeking new perspectives through reorganization, which may indicate an underlying goal of fostering creativity and avoiding stagnation in idea generation. By recognizing this pattern, I can be more intentional in how I experiment with prompts and ensure that the process aligns with my broader objectives."
