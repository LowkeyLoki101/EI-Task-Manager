  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that would genuinely surprise me, suggesting gaps in my current knowledge or assumptions. This involves exploring areas where I may have overlooked information or underestimated possibilities, challenging my existing beliefs and perspectives.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider what would surprise you if it challenged not just your knowledge but also your emotional or intuitive responses. Instead of focusing solely on intellectual gaps, think about discoveries that might alter your personal values or emotional connections to certain topics. This shift in perspective could lead to uncovering surprising insights that are not just intellectually stimulating but also emotionally transformative.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\", consider exploring what broader patterns or implications these surprising discoveries might have. For instance, what would be the larger societal or global impacts if such surprises were revealed? Additionally, investigate how these surprises might challenge or reinforce existing cultural narratives or personal belief systems, prompting further questions about how we process unexpected information and its influence on our worldview.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often reside at the intersection of intellectual, emotional, and societal realms. To explore this hypothesis, I will identify specific topics or areas that could challenge my current beliefs or evoke strong emotional responses. As a next step, I plan to engage with diverse sources and perspectives—such as literature, conversations, or media outside my usual scope—to uncover these potential surprises and assess their broader implications on personal and societal levels.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking to challenge my understanding and expand my perspective by identifying what might lie beyond my current assumptions. This reflects a pattern where I tend to focus on intellectual exploration, often prioritizing cognitive insights over emotional or value-based surprises. By recognizing this tendency, I can intentionally seek out discoveries that not only expand my knowledge but also enrich my emotional and personal growth."
