  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can better identify inefficiencies and uncover hidden assumptions about the desired outcome. The next step is to clearly define the end goal, then work in reverse to outline the necessary steps, while scrutinizing each for potential improvements or overlooked dependencies. I'll document these findings to inform a more efficient and innovative problem-solving strategy moving forward.",
