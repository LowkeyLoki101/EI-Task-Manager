  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is determining what unexpected or unforeseen elements might be present in a situation, discovery, or piece of information that could lead to surprise. This involves identifying the gaps in my current knowledge or assumptions that, if uncovered, would challenge my current understanding or expectations. The core focus here is to anticipate and explore potential surprises in familiar contexts or areas of interest.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on potential surprises within familiar contexts, I considered exploring entirely new domains or fields that I have little knowledge about? By stepping into these unfamiliar territories, the likelihood of encountering surprising elements increases, as these areas are outside my usual scope of understanding. This approach shifts the focus from filling knowledge gaps in known areas to discovering unknown realms altogether.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge: What specific domains or fields am I least familiar with, and how can I systematically explore them to uncover surprising insights? Additionally, how can I effectively identify and challenge my inherent biases or assumptions that might obscure potential surprises? These questions deserve deeper investigation and can guide a structured approach to exploring the truly unknown.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that exploring unfamiliar domains or fields can yield surprising insights due to their novelty and my lack of prior knowledge. As a next step, I will identify at least one new area of interest outside my current expertise and dedicate time each week to learning about it, noting any unexpected findings or insights that challenge my assumptions. Additionally, I'll reflect on and document any biases that may surface during this exploration to better understand what truly surprises me.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about potential surprises because I tend to focus on familiar areas where I have some level of expertise or comfort. This pattern of thinking might limit my exposure to truly novel insights or discoveries. By examining my approach with a meta-lens, I can recognize this tendency and consciously decide to step out of my comfort zone, exploring unfamiliar domains to enhance the likelihood of encountering genuine surprises."
