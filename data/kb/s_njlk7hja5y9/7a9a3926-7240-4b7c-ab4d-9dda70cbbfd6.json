  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the questions I avoid or find uncomfortable are likely tied to underlying fears or assumptions that need addressing. As a next step, I will dedicate time to journaling about these avoided questions, exploring why they make me uncomfortable and how facing them could contribute to my growth. This will provide a structured approach to uncovering and addressing areas that may have been previously neglected in my self-reflection.",
