  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is exploring the potential of generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling the prompts, novel combinations and perspectives could emerge, leading to fresh approaches or questions that were not initially considered. This process could enhance creativity and problem-solving by breaking away from conventional thought patterns.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of shuffling prompts, you approached each prompt with a different mindset or emotional state? By intentionally altering your mood or perspective before engaging with a prompt, new interpretations and insights might emerge. This shift could lead to a deeper understanding of the prompts or inspire innovative solutions that are influenced by the emotional context in which they are considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling your prompts, a new question arises: How do different combinations influence the meaning or perceived importance of each prompt? This leads to deeper investigation into the cognitive processes involved in interpreting shuffled information and whether certain combinations consistently yield more innovative or meaningful outcomes. Furthermore, it could be valuable to research the role of randomness in creativity and problem-solving, examining how unpredictability might foster breakthroughs.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can indeed lead to novel insights by disrupting conventional thought patterns. As a next step, I will create a list of my existing prompts and use a randomization tool to shuffle them, then approach each shuffled prompt with a different mindset or emotional state to explore how these factors influence my interpretations and the creativity of my responses. This experiment will help determine if and how these new combinations facilitate innovative thinking.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking new perspectives and insights that might not be apparent with my current approach. This reflects a pattern of continually striving to break free from routine thought processes to foster creativity and innovation. By questioning my method of prompt interaction, I'm emphasizing a desire to explore beyond conventional boundaries and to adapt my thinking to uncover novel ideas."
