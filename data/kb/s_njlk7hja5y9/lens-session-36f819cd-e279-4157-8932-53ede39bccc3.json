  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the outcomes of tackling an issue in reverse order. By approaching the problem backwards, we might uncover overlooked perspectives or solutions that aren't apparent when following the usual process. This approach could lead to innovative solutions by challenging assumptions and revealing hidden dependencies or steps in the problem-solving process.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of approaching the problem backwards, we considered the end result first and worked our way back to the beginning? By envisioning the desired outcome, we could identify critical milestones or steps that are necessary to achieve the final goal. This perspective might highlight the importance of certain actions or decisions that could be overlooked when following a traditional forward approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "One question that emerges is: What are the potential hidden dependencies or steps that could be uncovered by reversing the problem-solving process? Additionally, could this backward approach reveal any assumptions we are unknowingly making, and how might these impact our understanding of the problem? Further investigation could involve identifying specific case studies or historical examples where reverse-engineering a problem led to successful or unexpected outcomes, providing insights into how this methodology can be effectively applied.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards could reveal critical steps and assumptions that are not evident in a forward approach. The next action I will take is to select a specific problem to apply this reverse methodology, carefully documenting each backward step and any new insights or dependencies that emerge. This experiment will help determine the effectiveness and applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens to the trigger \"What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?\", I'm essentially examining why I'm drawn to this unconventional approach right now. This might indicate a pattern of seeking innovative or non-linear solutions when traditional methods aren't yielding results. It highlights a tendency to challenge conventional thinking and explore alternative pathways, suggesting a desire for a fresh perspective that could lead to breakthroughs or uncover hidden aspects of the problem. This pattern could be beneficial for fostering creativity and innovation but may also signal a need to balance it with structured problem-solving when necessary."
