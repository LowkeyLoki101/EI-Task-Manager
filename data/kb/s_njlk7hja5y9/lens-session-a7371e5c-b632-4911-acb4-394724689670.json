  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a meaningful or potentially overlooked question that I haven't considered recently. This involves introspection to uncover areas of my life or thinking that may need revisiting or reevaluation. By doing so, I can gain fresh insights or address any blind spots that have developed over time.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a specific question I haven't asked myself, I could reframe this by exploring why I haven't felt the need to question certain aspects of my life recently. What assumptions am I making that might be preventing me from asking new or challenging questions? By examining these underlying assumptions, I might uncover areas where my curiosity or critical thinking has become stagnant, leading to fresh opportunities for growth and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, we could ask: What specific areas of my life or thinking have I consistently neglected to question, and why might that be? Additionally, how might exploring these neglected areas reveal interconnected issues or insights that could benefit other aspects of my life? Investigating these could warrant deeper research into the patterns and habits that have led to their oversight.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are underlying assumptions in my life that I haven't challenged or questioned recently, potentially leading to stagnant thinking. As a next step, I will dedicate time to journaling about areas of my life where I feel most comfortable or routine, identifying any assumptions that might be worth reexamining. This practice should help uncover new questions to explore and stimulate personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Right now, I'm thinking about uncovering unasked questions because it prompts deeper self-reflection and growth. This pattern of introspection suggests a tendency to periodically reassess my perspectives and assumptions, seeking areas where my thinking might be stagnant. By routinely engaging in this meta-cognitive exercise, I aim to ensure continuous personal development and avoid complacency in my thought processes."
