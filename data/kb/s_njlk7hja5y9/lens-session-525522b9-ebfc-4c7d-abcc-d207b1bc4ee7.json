  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a potentially overlooked area of self-reflection or inquiry. The direct issue is pinpointing important questions that might have been neglected, which could lead to personal growth or new insights. It involves reflecting on past experiences, current situations, or future aspirations to discover what aspects of life or self-awareness need more attention.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what questions you've neglected, consider the values or goals that have shifted over time. This approach reframes the inquiry to explore how your priorities and perspectives have evolved, potentially revealing new areas for growth or understanding. By examining the broader context of your life changes, you might uncover new questions that align with your current journey.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this inquiry, new questions emerge, such as: \"How have my life experiences or changes in circumstances influenced the types of questions I consider important?\" and \"What assumptions am I currently holding that need re-evaluation?\" These questions suggest a deeper investigation into the evolution of your thought processes and how external factors shape your self-inquiry. Exploring these areas may uncover underlying beliefs or biases that warrant further examination, potentially leading to more meaningful self-reflection.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I might have overlooked questions related to how my priorities and values have evolved over time. As a next step, I'll set aside time this week to reflect on recent life changes and shifts in my goals, asking myself, \"What new directions or interests have emerged, and what questions do they inspire?\" This reflection could help uncover areas for personal growth and lead to more informed decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking deeper self-awareness and personal growth by exploring areas I've potentially overlooked. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too narrowly on specific questions, rather than examining the broader shifts in my values or circumstances that could reveal new, relevant inquiries. By using a meta-lens, I can better understand how my approach to self-reflection is evolving and how it aligns with my current life context."
