  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify critical steps or assumptions that might be overlooked when using traditional methods. The next action I will take is to map out the desired outcome and trace backwards through each step to the beginning, ensuring that I critically evaluate the necessity and impact of each step. This will help uncover any hidden assumptions or inefficiencies in the current approach.",
