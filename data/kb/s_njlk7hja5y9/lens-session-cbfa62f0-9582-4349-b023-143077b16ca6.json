  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a specific issue that causes discomfort or anxiety, such as a challenging work project, a strained personal relationship, or a significant life decision. By not addressing it, I might be experiencing stress or procrastination, which could lead to negative consequences. It's important to identify and confront this issue to develop a plan for resolution and regain a sense of control and clarity.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something to be avoided due to its discomfort or anxiety-inducing nature, reframe it as an opportunity for growth and learning. By confronting this issue, you have the chance to develop new skills, improve your resilience, and potentially strengthen relationships or enhance your decision-making abilities. This shift in perspective can transform the problem from a source of stress to a catalyst for positive change and personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, the question arises: What are the underlying fears or beliefs that cause me to avoid this problem? Additionally, it warrants deeper investigation into whether there are patterns in how I typically deal with discomfort or anxiety-inducing situations. Exploring these aspects could reveal insights into my coping mechanisms and inform more effective strategies for addressing the problem head-on.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a recurring pattern of procrastination around tasks that induce anxiety or fear of failure. The next step is to schedule a specific time to confront this problem, breaking it into smaller, manageable tasks to reduce overwhelm. Additionally, I'll reflect on past experiences to identify successful strategies I've used in similar situations and apply them here to build confidence and resilience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it's essential to address underlying issues that might be causing stress or hindering my progress in various aspects of life. The pattern I am repeating is avoiding uncomfortable situations or decisions, which only compounds the problem and prevents personal growth. By using the meta-lens, I can recognize this avoidance pattern and intentionally choose to face challenges head-on, fostering greater self-awareness and proactive problem-solving."
