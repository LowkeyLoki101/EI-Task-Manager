  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a specific assumption that I might be holding onto without questioning its validity. I need to clearly recognize and articulate the assumption in question to evaluate its accuracy and impact on my decision-making or understanding. This involves reflecting on my current beliefs and identifying any potential areas where my assumptions might not align with reality.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying assumptions, consider the possibility that the entire premise of needing to identify a single assumption might be flawed. What if the issue is not about finding a wrong assumption but rather accepting that multiple assumptions could be simultaneously influencing your perspective? By broadening the scope, you can shift from pinpointing a specific assumption to evaluating how a network of assumptions might collectively skew your understanding or approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In exploring the possibility of multiple assumptions influencing my perspective, new questions emerge: What are the interconnected assumptions that shape my current understanding? How do these assumptions collectively impact my decision-making processes? Further investigation could involve mapping out these assumptions to see how they relate to each other and identifying which ones might have the most significant influence on my judgments or actions. This could lead to a more comprehensive reevaluation of my belief systems and strategies.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a network of interconnected assumptions is influencing my perspective, rather than a single erroneous assumption. The next step is to map out these assumptions and analyze how they collectively impact my decision-making. I will create a visual diagram to better understand their interrelationships and identify which assumptions may need reevaluation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this question to enhance my self-awareness and decision-making by uncovering potentially flawed assumptions. This pattern of seeking to identify a singular wrong assumption could indicate a tendency to view problems as having one root cause, rather than acknowledging the complexity and interplay of multiple factors. By recognizing this pattern, I can adopt a more holistic approach, considering how various assumptions intertwine to influence my perspective."
