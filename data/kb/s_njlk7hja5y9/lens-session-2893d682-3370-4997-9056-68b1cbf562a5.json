  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is the potential misalignment between my assumptions and reality. Specifically, I need to identify which assumptions I'm holding that may not accurately reflect the current situation or information. By pinpointing these assumptions, I can address any discrepancies and ensure my actions or decisions are based on a more accurate understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying incorrect assumptions, reframe the situation to explore what assumptions could actually be beneficial if they were challenged. Consider how questioning these assumptions might open up new opportunities or insights. This perspective shift encourages not just correction but also innovation and growth by allowing space for alternative viewpoints and creative solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What are the underlying reasons for holding these assumptions in the first place? Are there patterns in the types of assumptions I tend to make that could be explored further? This deserves deeper investigation into the cognitive biases or external influences that shape these assumptions, as well as an examination of how challenging them could lead to broader systemic changes in my approach to problem-solving or decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging the assumptions I hold, I can improve my decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. The next step is to systematically list these assumptions and evaluate them against current evidence or alternative perspectives. I'll then prioritize which assumptions to address first, focusing on those with the most significant potential impact on my goals or decisions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about challenging my assumptions right now because it's a crucial step in ensuring that my understanding and decisions are based on reality rather than misconceptions. This is a pattern in my approach where I routinely question my assumptions to avoid complacency and foster a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. By doing so, I aim to uncover hidden biases and discover new pathways for problem-solving and innovation."
