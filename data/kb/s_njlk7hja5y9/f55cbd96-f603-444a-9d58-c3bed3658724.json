  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by identifying a current, impactful industry trend and integrating it into a simulation model as a dynamic, interactive element, we can generate fresh data that anticipates future scenarios. The next step is to select a specific trend and assemble a team of diverse stakeholders for a collaborative workshop to define the parameters of the simulation. This will ensure the simulation model is both innovative and grounded, allowing us to create actionable insights.",
