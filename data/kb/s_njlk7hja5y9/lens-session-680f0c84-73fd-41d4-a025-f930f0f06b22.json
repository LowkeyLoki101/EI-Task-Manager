  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The core idea is to explore the outcomes and insights gained by reversing the conventional approach to a problem. By starting from the intended outcome and working backwards, one can identify potential gaps, alternative strategies, and innovative solutions that might not be visible when following a traditional, forward-thinking method. This approach could reveal assumptions and dependencies that are not immediately apparent in a linear progression.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we looked at this problem not just by reversing the steps but by considering the problem from the perspective of what shouldn't happen? By identifying potential pitfalls or undesired outcomes first, we can uncover new strategies or solutions that preemptively address these concerns. This negative-space approach might illuminate overlooked risks and help prioritize actions that ensure a more robust and resilient solution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, new questions arise such as: What assumptions are inherently challenged by reversing the process? How does starting from the outcome redefine the initial problem or goals? Further investigation could focus on the nature of dependencies and how they might be re-sequenced or altered to optimize the solution. Additionally, exploring case studies where a reverse approach led to innovative outcomes could provide valuable insights and strategies applicable to the current problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I might uncover hidden assumptions and innovative solutions that aren't apparent in a traditional forward-thinking approach. The next step is to identify specific outcomes I want to achieve and work backwards to map out the steps needed to reach them, ensuring I address potential pitfalls and dependencies along the way. I will also research case studies where a reverse approach led to successful solutions, which could offer additional insights and strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching problems backwards because it challenges conventional thinking patterns and opens up alternative pathways for problem-solving. This pattern of reversing processes reflects a desire to uncover hidden insights and ensure comprehensive understanding by questioning assumptions and dependencies. By consistently applying this backward-thinking approach, I aim to foster innovative and resilient solutions that might be missed with traditional methods."
