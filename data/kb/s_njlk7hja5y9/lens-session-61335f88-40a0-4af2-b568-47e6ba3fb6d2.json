  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the potential for creativity and novelty by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling your own prompts, you can uncover new angles and perspectives, potentially leading to fresh ideas and insights that may not have been apparent in their original form. This approach encourages flexibility and innovation in thought processes.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, shuffling your own prompts can be seen as a way to challenge your cognitive biases and habitual thinking patterns. Rather than merely seeking new ideas, this approach becomes a tool for personal growth and self-awareness, revealing how the rearrangement of familiar elements can break the constraints of routine thought processes. This could lead to a more profound understanding of how you generate ideas and how flexibility in thinking can be cultivated.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Shuffling your own prompts not only generates new questions but also raises deeper queries about the nature of creativity and innovation. For instance, how does the act of rearranging familiar elements influence our cognitive processes and problem-solving skills? Further investigation could explore whether this method can be systematically applied in educational or professional settings to enhance creative thinking and adaptability. Additionally, examining the psychological impact of such exercises on reducing cognitive biases presents another rich avenue for research.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my own prompts can lead to unexpected insights and foster a more flexible mindset. The next step is to actively engage in this exercise by selecting a few prompts, shuffling them, and observing the new combinations that emerge. This experiment will help me assess its impact on creative thinking and identify any novel questions or ideas that arise from the process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts to break free from established cognitive patterns and to encourage creative thinking. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking novelty and innovation by disrupting familiar structures. By using this meta-lens, I recognize a tendency to rely on reorganization as a method to access new insights, suggesting a habitual approach to problem-solving that values adaptability and flexibility."
