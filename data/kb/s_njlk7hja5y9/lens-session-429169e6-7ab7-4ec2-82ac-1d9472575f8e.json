  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is determining which type of simulation can be designed and executed to generate new, relevant data. The goal is to identify a simulation model that aligns with our specific objectives or research questions, ensuring that the data produced is useful and applicable to our current needs.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what simulation to run, consider reframing the approach to explore what specific data gaps exist and how they align with our strategic goals. By identifying the precise data needs first, we can then determine if a simulation is indeed the best method to fill these gaps or if other data generation techniques might be more effective. This shift in perspective prioritizes understanding the end goals before choosing the method to achieve them.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, we might ask: What existing simulations have been successful in similar contexts, and can they be adapted to our needs? Additionally, what potential variables or parameters in our system are not currently fully understood, and how might a simulation help uncover these insights? Further investigation could include examining the latest advancements in simulation technology to identify how they might enhance our data generation capabilities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that identifying the specific data gaps and aligning them with our strategic objectives is crucial before deciding on a simulation model. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis to pinpoint these data needs and evaluate whether a simulation is the optimal method for data generation. If so, we can then research which existing simulation models or technologies can be adapted to meet these requirements.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there's a pressing need to generate new data to support our objectives or research. This reflects a pattern of jumping to solutions—like running a simulation—without fully analyzing the underlying needs or considering alternative methods. By applying a meta-lens, I realize the importance of evaluating our habitual approach to problem-solving, ensuring it aligns with strategic goals and doesn't overlook simpler or more effective solutions."
