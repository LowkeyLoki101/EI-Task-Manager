  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by first analyzing existing datasets, I can identify specific gaps or patterns that will guide the design of a targeted simulation. The next step is to clearly define the objectives and questions we need the new data to address. Following this, I will explore current simulation technologies and consult with data modeling experts to develop a model that meets these objectives, ensuring the simulation's outcomes are both actionable and innovative.",
