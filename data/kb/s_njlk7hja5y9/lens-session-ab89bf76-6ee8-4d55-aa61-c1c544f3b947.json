  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that challenge current assumptions. It's about exploring what lies beyond the obvious or anticipated, and pinpointing what specific information or perspective would be surprising in a given context. This involves questioning what hidden elements or truths exist that, if uncovered, would shift understanding or perceptions.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from a different angle, consider the perspective of someone with a different background or expertise. What would surprise them if they found it? This shift challenges you to step outside your own assumptions and consider what unexpected insights might emerge when viewed through the lens of another discipline or cultural context. This approach could reveal blind spots or overlooked opportunities that are not apparent within your own frame of reference.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying a recursive lens to the original trigger, one might ask: What underlying assumptions contribute to the potential surprise, and how can these be further questioned or deconstructed? Additionally, consider what foundational knowledge or beliefs might be challenged if the surprising discovery were made, and what further inquiries this might prompt about related phenomena or systems. This recursive approach could lead to a deeper examination of the sources of surprise and a broader investigation into interconnected topics.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that uncovering unexpected insights often involves challenging underlying assumptions and exploring perspectives beyond one's usual frame of reference. As a next step, I will actively seek out diverse viewpoints and question existing beliefs in a specific area of interest, aiming to identify surprising elements that could shift my understanding. This involves engaging with experts from different disciplines or cultures to gain fresh perspectives and uncover hidden insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "You're thinking about unexpected discoveries because it challenges the status quo and encourages innovative thinking. The pattern here may be a habitual focus on uncovering hidden insights to drive creativity or problem-solving. By stepping back, you aim to disrupt conventional thinking patterns and open up to new possibilities that could lead to transformative insights or breakthroughs."
