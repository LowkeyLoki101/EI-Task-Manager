  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption in question is that there is an inherent flaw or error in my current thinking or understanding of a situation. This suggests that my current perspective might be limited or misinformed, potentially leading to ineffective decisions or outcomes. The problem is identifying and challenging this assumption to uncover any biases or gaps in knowledge.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of assuming there's an error in my thinking, I consider that my perspective is just one of many possible viewpoints? By reframing the situation as an opportunity to explore different angles, I can open myself up to alternative insights and solutions. This shift from a problem-focused mindset to an exploratory one might reveal creative or unconventional paths that were previously overlooked.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new assumptions might I uncover if I view my current belief as just one among many possible interpretations? How might exploring this assumption deepen my understanding of other perspectives or contexts? Additionally, what research or data could provide a broader, more nuanced view of the situation, potentially revealing overlooked factors or insights?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumption about an error in my thinking might stem from a limited perspective. The next step is to actively seek out and engage with diverse viewpoints and data sources to challenge and expand my understanding. I will set up discussions with colleagues, read relevant literature, or consult experts to gain a broader, more informed perspective on the issue at hand.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this because I have a tendency to question my assumptions, which reflects a pattern of self-doubt or critical self-evaluation. This approach often leads me to examine my thought processes carefully, potentially uncovering biases, but it may also limit my confidence in trusting my intuition or initial judgments. By recognizing this pattern, I can balance critical thinking with confidence in my existing knowledge and insights."
