  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the outcomes of tackling an issue from the end result back to the starting point. By reversing the traditional approach, I aim to uncover new insights or solutions that might be overlooked when moving forward sequentially. This method could reveal dependencies or steps that are critical to success but not immediately obvious.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from a different angle, consider approaching it from a lateral perspective rather than strictly backwards. Instead of starting at the end and moving sequentially to the beginning, imagine working sideways by identifying parallel processes or alternative paths that achieve similar outcomes. This could reveal innovative strategies or untapped resources that might not be apparent in a linear or reverse-linear approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the idea of approaching a problem backwards, we might ask: What are the potential challenges or unintended consequences of reversing each step? Could there be foundational assumptions in the original forward approach that need re-evaluation when reversed? Additionally, exploring how other disciplines or fields successfully utilize reverse engineering could provide deeper insights or innovative strategies that can be applied to this problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards or from a lateral perspective, I may uncover critical insights into the dependencies and assumptions that underpin the issue. The next step is to map out the desired end result and work backwards to identify key processes and assumptions, while also exploring alternative paths and parallel processes that could achieve the same outcome. This approach will help in recognizing innovative strategies and potential pitfalls.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because I'm seeking innovative solutions that may be missed with conventional methods. This pattern of exploring unconventional approaches reflects my desire to challenge the status quo and find unique insights. It suggests a pattern of seeking novelty and breaking away from linear thinking, which can sometimes limit creative problem-solving."
