  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is the potential oversight of incorrect assumptions influencing decisions or beliefs. The assumption in question is unidentified, which creates uncertainty and possible errors in judgment. The task is to identify and challenge these assumptions to ensure they align with reality.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a potentially incorrect assumption, consider reframing the situation as an opportunity to explore multiple perspectives. What if, rather than being wrong, the assumption is simply one of many possible interpretations? This opens the door to a broader understanding and encourages the exploration of diverse viewpoints, which can lead to more informed and balanced decisions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive nature of questioning assumptions, one might ask: What underlying beliefs or biases influence the assumptions being made? Additionally, how could different contexts or new information alter the perceived correctness of these assumptions? This invites a deeper investigation into the origins of these assumptions and the potential for evolving them in light of new evidence or perspectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the assumption I'm questioning may be influenced by underlying biases or limited perspectives. The next step is to actively seek out diverse viewpoints and additional information to challenge and potentially validate or refute this assumption. I will engage with others in discussions or conduct research to gather insights that could either reinforce or reshape my current understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I recognize the importance of questioning my assumptions to avoid potential biases and errors in judgment. This pattern of introspection is a recurring approach I use to ensure my decisions are well-founded and to foster continuous learning. By stepping back, I aim to cultivate a habit of critical thinking and openness to diverse perspectives, which can enhance both personal growth and decision-making processes."
