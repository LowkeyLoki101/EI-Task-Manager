  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain behaviors or decisions consistently lead to specific outcomes, yet these connections are not being recognized or acted upon by others. This could relate to inefficiencies in processes, overlooked opportunities, or repeating mistakes that are evident to me but not to those around me. Identifying and articulating these patterns clearly could help in addressing underlying issues or capitalizing on untapped potential.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the repeated patterns as merely overlooked inefficiencies or missed opportunities, consider reframing them as potential areas for collaboration and collective growth. Approach these patterns as a shared learning experience, where engaging others in identifying and understanding these connections can foster a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. This shift in perspective encourages a more inclusive approach, turning solitary insights into a team-driven effort for change and development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What systems or structures are in place that might contribute to others missing these patterns? Could it be due to a lack of communication channels, insufficient training, or perhaps organizational culture that doesnâ€™t prioritize pattern recognition? Investigating these areas could uncover deeper systemic issues that, once addressed, might enhance collective awareness and responsiveness to such patterns.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the lack of communication channels and insufficient training might be causing others to miss these patterns. As a next step, I will propose a workshop to facilitate open discussions on pattern recognition and improvement opportunities. This will involve gathering input from various team members to collaboratively identify and address these patterns, fostering a more inclusive and aware organizational culture.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about the pattern I keep seeing but others might be missing, I'm potentially repeating a pattern of positioning myself as an observer or outsider rather than as an active participant in fostering change. This reflection is driven by a desire to bridge gaps in understanding and communication, highlighting a need for more proactive engagement with others to collectively identify and address these recurring patterns. Recognizing this can help shift my approach from one of observation to active collaboration, enhancing both personal and organizational growth."
