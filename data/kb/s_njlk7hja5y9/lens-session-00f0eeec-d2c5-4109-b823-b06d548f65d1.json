  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could challenge my current understanding or assumptions. This involves considering areas where there might be hidden information or overlooked perspectives that, once revealed, would provoke surprise or a shift in thinking. The goal is to pinpoint these potential surprises to foster learning and adaptation.",
  "reframeStep": "From another perspective, consider the idea of surprise not as a disruption but as an opportunity for growth. Instead of seeking out what might shock or unsettle, think about what could delight or inspire you. What discoveries could bring unexpected joy or motivation, leading to creative breakthroughs or deeper engagement with your interests?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" prompts further inquiries into the underlying assumptions and biases that shape my current understanding. This could lead to exploring questions like: What assumptions am I making that I am not aware of? How do my cultural, educational, or personal experiences influence what I consider surprising? Additionally, investigating areas where I have blind spots or where my knowledge is limited could reveal broader patterns or connections that are currently invisible to me, warranting deeper research into these domains.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often lie in areas where I hold strong assumptions or have limited knowledge. To act on this, I will identify key topics or beliefs where I feel most confident and seek out materials or perspectives that challenge these views. This could involve reading contrarian articles, engaging in discussions with individuals who hold different opinions, or exploring unfamiliar fields to uncover potential surprises that could lead to growth and new insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I have a habit of seeking out novel information or unexpected insights to challenge my existing beliefs and assumptions. This pattern reflects a broader approach of valuing curiosity and openness to change, often driving me to explore beyond the surface of my current knowledge. Applying a meta-lens here allows me to recognize this tendency and consider how I can balance the pursuit of surprise with the need for stability and coherence in my understanding."
