  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see that there is a recurring pattern or trend that frequently catches my attention, but it seems to go unnoticed by others around me. This could be related to a particular behavior, market trend, or opportunity that I consistently observe and recognize, yet it remains overlooked by my peers or colleagues. It's important to identify whether this is due to a unique perspective I have or if it's simply an underappreciated insight that needs to be communicated more effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I keep seeing is not actually being missed by others, but rather, they are interpreting it differently based on their own experiences and biases? Alternatively, could it be that the pattern is not as evident or relevant to others because they are focused on different priorities or goals? This shift in perspective could lead me to engage in conversations with others to understand their viewpoints and explore whether there is a way to bridge our understandings for mutual benefit.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific factors contribute to my unique perception of this pattern? Are there particular skills, experiences, or biases that enable me to see it more clearly? Additionally, what steps can I take to validate whether this pattern is genuinely significant and not just a product of my own confirmation bias? Further research could involve gathering data, seeking diverse perspectives, and testing hypotheses to see if the pattern holds true across different contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I notice is significant and may be overlooked by others due to differing perspectives or priorities. As a next step, I will initiate discussions with peers to share my observations and gather their insights. Additionally, I will conduct a small-scale study or analysis to collect data that either supports or challenges my perception of the pattern, ensuring my conclusions are well-founded.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because I often find myself in situations where I notice trends or behaviors that others overlook, which may stem from a tendency to seek out hidden opportunities or insights. This pattern of observation could be a recurring approach where I focus on uncovering what is not immediately apparent, possibly reflecting a broader pattern of valuing unique perspectives or striving to provide value through novel insights. Understanding this could help me better communicate these observations and engage others in discussions that align with their interests and priorities."
