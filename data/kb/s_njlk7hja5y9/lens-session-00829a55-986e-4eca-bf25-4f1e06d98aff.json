  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem framed here is identifying unexpected discoveries that could challenge current assumptions or beliefs. It involves exploring areas or ideas where surprises may occur, potentially leading to new insights or innovations. This requires an open-minded approach to uncovering insights that are hidden or overlooked in existing knowledge or experiences.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from the perspective of innovation and personal growth, consider what unexpected discoveries could reveal about your own blind spots or areas of potential development. Instead of focusing solely on external surprises, think about how these findings might highlight inherent biases or assumptions you hold. This shift in perspective encourages a deeper self-reflection and openness to change, allowing for personal and professional evolution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, consider what underlying assumptions or beliefs would need to be re-evaluated if you encountered a surprising discovery. What questions about your current understanding or worldview does this raise, and how might these revelations affect your future decisions or actions? Additionally, explore how this potential surprise might connect to broader societal or technological trends, prompting a deeper investigation into how these findings could impact larger systems or communities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas where I have entrenched beliefs or where I have not previously looked. To address this, my next step is to actively seek out perspectives and information outside my usual sources, engaging with diverse viewpoints and exploring topics I typically overlook. This action will likely highlight areas where I hold biases or assumptions, fostering growth and potentially leading to innovative insights.",
