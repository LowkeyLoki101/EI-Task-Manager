  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain issues or opportunities are consistently overlooked by others in discussions or decision-making processes. This might be due to a lack of diverse perspectives or an over-reliance on conventional thinking. Clearly identifying this pattern can help in proposing innovative solutions or highlighting neglected areas that require attention.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I'm noticing is not actually being overlooked by others, but rather it's a pattern that is emerging from my unique experiences or biases? By considering this, I could explore whether my perspective is highlighting something truly novel or if it's simply a reflection of my personal lens. This shift in perspective can encourage me to engage with others more openly, seeking their insights and potentially finding shared patterns that are mutually beneficial.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific biases or experiences might be influencing my perception of the pattern, and how can I objectively assess their impact? Additionally, how can I engage with a diverse group of people to gain multiple perspectives on this pattern to determine whether it is truly novel or shared? Further investigation could involve researching similar patterns in different contexts to see if they have been recognized and addressed before, potentially offering insights or solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I'm observing might be influenced by my own biases or unique experiences. To test this, I will engage with a diverse group of individuals to gather their perspectives and see if they recognize the same patterns. Additionally, I will research similar patterns in other contexts to see if they have been addressed, which could provide valuable insights or solutions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern now because I'm driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully by identifying gaps that others might not see. This approach often repeats a pattern of seeking validation through uncovering overlooked issues, which may stem from a personal value I place on innovation and impact. By recognizing this, I can balance my focus on novelty with an openness to valuing existing insights and perspectives, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive approach."
