  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the potential for new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts or questions. I see an opportunity to uncover fresh perspectives or solutions by altering the sequence or combination of prompts I typically use. The goal is to discover what unique or unexpected prompts might emerge from this rearrangement.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached the shuffling of prompts as a collaborative exercise rather than a solitary one? By inviting others to contribute to or rearrange the prompts, I might gain insights from diverse perspectives, leading to even more innovative and unexpected ideas. This shift in perspective emphasizes the value of collective creativity and the potential for richer outcomes through shared input.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should I use to determine which prompt combinations are most insightful or valuable? Additionally, how might the process of shuffling prompts be systematized or enhanced using tools such as AI or randomization algorithms to ensure a broad range of new ideas and perspectives? These questions warrant deeper investigation to maximize the creative potential of rearranging prompts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by systematically shuffling prompts and involving others in the process, we can generate a wider range of innovative ideas and insights. The next step is to design a collaborative exercise where participants contribute and rearrange prompts, and then evaluate the outcomes for creativity and novelty. I will also explore using AI tools to aid in the randomization and combination of prompts to ensure diverse and unexpected results.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking to break out of routine thinking patterns and foster creativity. The pattern I'm repeating is my tendency to rely on established methods and prompts, which might limit innovative ideas. By examining this pattern, I realize the importance of introducing variability and collaboration to stimulate new insights and diverse perspectives."
