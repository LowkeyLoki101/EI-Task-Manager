  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is exploring the effects of tackling a problem in reverse order. This involves identifying the desired outcome first and then working backwards to determine the necessary steps, assumptions, and resources needed to achieve that outcome. By framing the problem this way, we can better understand the potential benefits and challenges of using a reverse approach, such as uncovering overlooked steps or simplifying complex processes.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of starting with the desired outcome, we began by understanding the constraints and limitations first? By reversing the reverse approach, we could identify potential barriers and resources upfront, allowing us to map out feasible paths to the goal more strategically. This perspective might reveal alternative pathways or innovative solutions that wouldn't have been considered if we only focused on working backwards from the desired outcome.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the idea of approaching problems backwards raises several new questions: How do different domains, such as project management or creative writing, benefit from reverse problem-solving? Could there be a universal framework for backward problem-solving that applies across various fields? Further investigation could focus on case studies where reverse approaches yielded innovative solutions, or research into cognitive biases that might hinder or enhance backward thinking.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can uncover overlooked steps and simplify processes by starting with the desired outcome and identifying the necessary steps in reverse. The next step is to test this hypothesis by selecting a specific problem, such as a project management task, and applying a reverse problem-solving approach to see if it reveals any new insights or efficiencies. I will document the process and results to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in practice.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching this problem backwards because I'm seeking new perspectives that might uncover hidden insights or simplify complex issues. This pattern of reversing approaches indicates a desire for innovation and a break from conventional problem-solving methods. By questioning my habitual forward-thinking process, I aim to enhance creativity and adaptability in tackling challenges."
