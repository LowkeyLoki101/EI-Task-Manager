  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the pattern I notice may be influenced by specific cognitive biases that others may not share, leading to its oversight. My next step is to engage in a dialogue with a diverse group of colleagues to present my observations and invite their perspectives. This collaborative approach will help test the validity of my hypothesis and potentially reveal additional insights or confirm the pattern's broader significance.",
