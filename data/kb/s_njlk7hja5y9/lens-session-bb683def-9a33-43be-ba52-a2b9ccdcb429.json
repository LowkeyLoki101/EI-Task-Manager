  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying unexpected discoveries or realizations that could arise in a given context. Specifically, it involves recognizing what might be overlooked or assumed to be impossible, yet could exist or occur, prompting surprise upon discovery. The focus is on uncovering hidden or counterintuitive elements that challenge existing assumptions.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" from the perspective of personal growth, it becomes a question of exploring unfamiliar territories or ideas that challenge your current knowledge and beliefs. Instead of merely identifying surprising elements, consider it an opportunity to actively seek out those surprises as catalysts for learning and transformation. Shifting from a passive to an active stance encourages curiosity and openness to new experiences that can redefine your understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens on \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to questions about the underlying assumptions that make certain discoveries surprising in the first place. What fundamental beliefs or knowledge gaps do I have that could be challenged by such surprises? Additionally, it prompts an investigation into the processes and environments that cultivate or hinder the emergence of surprising discoveries, inviting deeper research into cognitive biases, learning methodologies, and the role of serendipity in innovation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often stem from challenging our fundamental assumptions and exploring unfamiliar territories. As a next step, I will actively seek out new experiences and knowledge areas outside my comfort zone, while reflecting on my cognitive biases and assumptions. This approach aims to foster an environment conducive to serendipitous discoveries that can prompt personal and intellectual growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it highlights the importance of challenging my current assumptions and seeking out new perspectives. This pattern of introspection and curiosity often leads to personal growth and innovation. By consistently questioning what might surprise me, I aim to break free from routine thinking and foster a mindset that embraces unexpected discoveries as opportunities for development."
