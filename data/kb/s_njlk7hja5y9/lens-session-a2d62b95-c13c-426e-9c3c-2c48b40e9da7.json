  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is about exploring the potential for new insights and creativity by rearranging existing prompts. The goal is to discover fresh perspectives or innovative questions that might not surface through the usual order or structure. This involves examining how the reordering of familiar elements can generate novel outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on the individual prompts, you considered the relationships and patterns between them when shuffled? This approach might lead to insights about how your thinking process is structured and reveal underlying themes or connections that weren't obvious before. By examining the interplay of prompts, you could uncover more about your cognitive biases and habitual thought patterns, ultimately leading to more profound and systemic innovation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling your prompts, consider how this process might reveal broader patterns or trends in your thinking that could be indicative of subconscious biases or preferences. What does the emergence of certain themes or repeated ideas say about your underlying assumptions? Additionally, could this practice inspire a method for developing a more diverse range of questions, leading to richer exploration and problem-solving? Exploring these aspects may warrant deeper investigation into cognitive diversity and its role in creativity.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my prompts, I can gain insights into my cognitive patterns and biases, uncovering potential areas for innovative questioning and thought diversity. The next step is to systematically shuffle and analyze my prompts to identify recurring themes or ideas, which could then be used to develop a framework for generating more varied and creative questions in future brainstorming sessions. This practice could enhance my ability to approach problems from multiple angles, leading to more comprehensive solutions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now to break free from my usual cognitive patterns and uncover hidden connections or insights that might not be apparent through conventional approaches. This exercise may reflect a recurring pattern in my approach to problem-solving: seeking novelty and creativity by disrupting established sequences. It highlights a tendency to explore the potential of reorganization as a means to stimulate innovative thinking."
