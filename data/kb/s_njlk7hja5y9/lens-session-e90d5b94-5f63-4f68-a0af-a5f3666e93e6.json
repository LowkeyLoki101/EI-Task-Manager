  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation to generate new, relevant data. The key is to determine the type of data needed and the context in which it will be used, whether it's for predictive analysis, testing hypotheses, or exploring new scenarios. This involves selecting a simulation model that aligns with the desired outcomes and available resources.",
  "reframeStep": "Rather than focusing on finding a specific simulation to generate new data, consider approaching the problem by first engaging with the stakeholders to understand their needs and questions about the data. From this perspective, the goal shifts to facilitating a collaborative exploration of potential simulations that could address these needs, fostering a shared understanding of the data's purpose. This could involve workshops or brainstorming sessions to collectively identify the most valuable simulations to run, thereby ensuring the data generated is both relevant and actionable.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider what foundational questions need to be addressed to refine the simulation approach. What are the assumptions underlying the current data needs, and how might different simulations challenge or validate these assumptions? Further, investigate what methodologies have been successful in similar contexts and explore potential innovations in simulation technologies that could be applied to gather more insightful data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that engaging with stakeholders to clearly define the data needs and objectives will guide the selection of a suitable simulation model. The next step is to organize a workshop with key stakeholders to collaboratively explore potential simulation scenarios and technologies that align with our goals. This approach ensures that the simulation will generate relevant and actionable data, tailored to the specific questions and needs of the organization.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this question now because there is a need to generate new data that will inform decision-making or enhance our understanding of a specific context. The pattern I'm repeating is focusing primarily on the technical aspects of creating simulations, rather than integrating a broader view that includes stakeholder engagement to ensure the data generated truly meets the needs and objectives set by the team or organization."
