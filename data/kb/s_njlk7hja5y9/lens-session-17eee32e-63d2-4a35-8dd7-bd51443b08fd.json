  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a recurring pattern or trend that I consistently observe but others seem to overlook. This pattern might be something that falls under common blind spots due to biases or lack of perspective. Clearly articulating this pattern and understanding why it's being missed is essential to addressing potential gaps or opportunities.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the pattern itself, we look at why others might be missing it? Perhaps itâ€™s due to differences in experiences, backgrounds, or roles that lead to varied perspectives. By exploring the unique vantage points from which others view the situation, new insights might emerge, revealing not just the pattern but also the reasons behind its invisibility to others. This shift in focus could foster collaboration and mutual understanding, leading to more comprehensive solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?\" prompts new questions: What specific experiences or knowledge do I possess that allow me to see this pattern? Can this pattern be validated through data or external feedback to ensure it's not an isolated perception? Additionally, how can I effectively communicate this pattern to others to encourage them to see it too, perhaps by using storytelling or data visualization methods? Exploring these questions could deepen understanding and facilitate broader recognition of the pattern.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I see may be influenced by my unique experiences and perspectives, which might not be shared by others. My next step is to validate this pattern through data analysis and gather external feedback to ensure it's not an isolated perception. Additionally, I'll focus on communicating this pattern effectively to others, possibly through storytelling or data visualization, to foster recognition and collaboration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am contemplating this pattern because I have a tendency to focus on identifying gaps or opportunities that others may overlook, possibly stemming from my own biases or strengths in pattern recognition. This recurring approach might reflect a broader pattern in my thinking where I assume a unique perspective without fully exploring or validating why others might not see the same things, potentially missing out on collaborative insights. By adopting a meta-lens, I can shift towards understanding these dynamics better and enhancing my approach through diverse input and perspectives."
