  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by identifying and challenging the assumptions I hold, I can improve my decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. The next step is to systematically list these assumptions and evaluate them against current evidence or alternative perspectives. I'll then prioritize which assumptions to address first, focusing on those with the most significant potential impact on my goals or decisions.",
