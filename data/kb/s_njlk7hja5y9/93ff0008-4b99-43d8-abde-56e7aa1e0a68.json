  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that a hybrid simulation approach, combining elements of existing models with real-world data inputs, will be most effective in generating the new data we need. The next step is to conduct a review of current simulation frameworks relevant to our field, evaluate their adaptability, and identify opportunities to integrate machine learning for enhanced data generation. I will compile a list of potential simulation techniques and consult with stakeholders to prioritize those that align best with our objectives.",
