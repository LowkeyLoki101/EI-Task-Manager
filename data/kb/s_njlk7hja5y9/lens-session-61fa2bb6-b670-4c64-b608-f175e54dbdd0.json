  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about a significant problem that may be causing stress or hindrance in my life. This problem could be related to personal relationships, career challenges, financial issues, or health concerns. By not addressing it, I might be delaying necessary actions or decisions that could lead to a resolution or improvement.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the problem you are avoiding might not be as daunting as it seems. Instead of focusing on its potential negative impact, think of it as an opportunity for growth and learning. By reframing the problem as a challenge that can lead to personal development, you might find the motivation to address it head-on and discover creative solutions you hadn't considered before.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By examining the problem you are avoiding, new questions arise such as: What underlying fears or beliefs are causing this avoidance? Are there past experiences that are influencing your current perception of this problem? Additionally, it might be worth investigating whether avoidance is a recurring pattern in your life and, if so, what strategies could be developed to break this cycle. Delving into these questions can provide deeper understanding and potentially lead to more effective ways to tackle not only this problem but future ones as well.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding likely stems from underlying fears or beliefs that I've yet to confront. The next step is to take some time for self-reflection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to identify these fears and understand their origins. I'll then create a plan to address the problem directly, breaking it down into manageable steps and seeking support if needed to ensure consistent progress.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this problem avoidance issue because it might be a recurring pattern where I shy away from uncomfortable situations, preferring short-term comfort over long-term solutions. This pattern could stem from a fear of failure or conflict, suggesting a need to develop resilience and proactive problem-solving skills. By recognizing and addressing this tendency, I can break the cycle and cultivate a more constructive approach to challenges."
