  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely something that causes discomfort or requires a difficult decision. It could be a personal issue, such as a strained relationship, or a professional challenge, like a career decision or workload management. Identifying the specific area or situation that triggers avoidance can help in addressing it directly.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing this problem as something to avoid due to discomfort, consider it as an opportunity for growth and learning. What if this challenge is a pivotal moment that could lead to significant personal or professional development? By shifting the perspective from avoidance to engagement, you can transform the problem into a stepping stone that enhances your resilience and problem-solving skills.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying fears or beliefs might be contributing to my avoidance of this problem? Could there be deeper issues, such as fear of failure or fear of conflict, that are influencing my reluctance to confront this challenge? Additionally, what specific steps can I take to gradually increase my comfort level with addressing this issue, and how might engaging with similar past challenges inform my approach? These questions deserve deeper exploration to uncover the root causes of avoidance and to develop strategies for effective problem engagement.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I'm avoiding thinking about a specific problem due to underlying fears, such as fear of failure or conflict. The next step is to identify exactly what this problem is by reflecting on recent situations that cause me discomfort or anxiety. I will set aside time to journal about these feelings and past experiences, aiming to uncover patterns or triggers, and then outline a plan to address the issue incrementally, focusing on manageable actions that build my confidence and resilience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it represents an underlying habit of avoidance that I've developed in response to discomfort or anxiety about uncertain outcomes. This pattern of avoidance likely stems from a desire to maintain comfort and stability, but it limits my growth and resilience. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously choose to break it, embrace challenges, and foster a mindset of curiosity and openness to change."
