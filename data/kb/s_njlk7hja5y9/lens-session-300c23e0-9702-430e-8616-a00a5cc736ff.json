  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or realizations in familiar contexts. Specifically, it involves pinpointing what elements or information, if encountered, would genuinely astonish or challenge my current understanding or assumptions about a situation or topic. This requires examining areas where I have strong preconceived notions or where I assume everything is already known.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this from the perspective of a beginner or an outsider? By setting aside my own expertise and looking at the situation with fresh eyes, I might discover surprising elements that I had previously overlooked or dismissed. This shift in perspective could reveal hidden assumptions or blind spots in my current understanding, leading to unexpected insights and learning opportunities.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively could lead to asking what specific areas of my knowledge or beliefs are most vulnerable to surprise, and why. It might also prompt a deeper investigation into the cognitive biases or habitual thought patterns that prevent me from expecting surprises. Additionally, this could involve researching methods or practices that help cultivate a mindset more open to unexpected findings, such as engaging in interdisciplinary studies or actively seeking out diverse perspectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching familiar contexts with a beginner's mindset and actively seeking diverse perspectives can lead to surprising discoveries. As a next step, I will identify a specific area of my expertise and engage with materials or discussions from an entirely different field or perspective, documenting any surprising insights or challenges to my current understanding. Additionally, I will reflect on and note any cognitive biases that surface during this process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger because I'm seeking to uncover hidden insights or challenge my existing assumptions. This approach reflects a pattern of curiosity and a desire to continuously learn and adapt by questioning what I take for granted. By consistently engaging in this kind of reflective inquiry, I aim to foster open-mindedness and innovation in my thinking processes."
