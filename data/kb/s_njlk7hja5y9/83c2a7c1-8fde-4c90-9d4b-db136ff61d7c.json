  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to explore emerging consumer behaviors as a dynamic element in designing simulations for data creation, rather than focusing solely on industry trends. The next step is to identify a specific consumer behavior trend and evaluate the technological tools available to simulate this behavior effectively. I will then develop a prototype simulation model to test the potential data outputs and their relevance to market needs.",
