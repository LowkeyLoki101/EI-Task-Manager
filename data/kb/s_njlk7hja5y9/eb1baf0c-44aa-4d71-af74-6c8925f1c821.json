  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts and inviting others to interpret them, I can unlock new perspectives and ideas that I wouldn't discover alone. As a next step, I will develop a collaborative platform or workshop where participants can shuffle and reinterpret prompts collectively, fostering a dynamic exchange of insights and creativity. This approach will help test the hypothesis and refine methods for maximizing the creative potential of prompt shuffling.",
