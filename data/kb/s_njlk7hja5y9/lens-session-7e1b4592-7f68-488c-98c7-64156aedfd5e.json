  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could challenge my current understanding or assumptions. What specific knowledge, fact, or outcome would genuinely catch me off guard if I encountered it? This involves considering areas where I may have blind spots or preconceived notions that could be overturned by new information or perspectives.",
  "reframeStep": "From another angle, consider the surprise not as a challenge to your current understanding, but as an opportunity for growth. What if the unexpected discovery was actually a missing piece that completed an entirely new puzzle rather than disrupting your current picture? This perspective shifts the focus from potential disruption to a mindset of curiosity and expansion, inviting you to actively seek out those surprises that could lead to innovative breakthroughs or personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this recursively, one might ask what underlying assumptions or biases could lead to being surprised in the first place. What foundational beliefs or knowledge gaps need to be examined to anticipate such surprises more effectively? Additionally, how can identifying these potential surprises guide further inquiry or research, perhaps by exploring unconventional sources or interdisciplinary approaches to uncover insights that are truly unexpected?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas where my current understanding is limited or based on unchallenged assumptions. As a next step, I will actively seek out perspectives and knowledge from fields outside my usual scope, such as interdisciplinary studies or unconventional research, to uncover insights that could surprise and inform my current views. This approach will not only help in identifying potential surprises but also facilitate a more comprehensive understanding and personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because I am seeking to challenge my assumptions and expand my understanding by identifying what could surprise me. The pattern I am repeating in my approach is a focus on discovery and learning, where I often look for gaps in my knowledge or new perspectives that could lead to growth or innovation. By stepping back, I can see that this process is part of a broader habit of inquiry and self-improvement, aiming to remain open to unexpected insights."
