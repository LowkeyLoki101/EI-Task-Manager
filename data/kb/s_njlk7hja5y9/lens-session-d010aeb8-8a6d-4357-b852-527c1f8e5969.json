  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The pattern I keep seeing that others might be missing is a recurring issue or opportunity that consistently appears in my environment or work, yet goes unnoticed by my peers. This could involve specific inefficiencies in a workflow, emerging trends in industry data, or behaviors that predict future outcomes. By identifying this pattern, I have the potential to address it proactively, leading to improved processes or strategic advantages.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the unnoticed pattern itself, I shift my perspective to understanding why this pattern is consistently overlooked by others? Perhaps there is a communication gap, a lack of diverse perspectives, or a cultural norm that discourages questioning the status quo. By addressing these underlying issues, I can foster an environment where these patterns are more readily identified and discussed by everyone, leading to collective improvements and innovations.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recognition of overlooked patterns, new questions arise: Why do certain individuals consistently notice these patterns while others do not? What cognitive biases or environmental factors contribute to this blindness? Further investigation could involve researching decision-making processes, the impact of diverse cognitive styles in problem-solving, and how organizational culture influences perception and attention. Understanding these dynamics could lead to strategies that enhance pattern recognition across teams.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I am noticing but others are missing is due to cognitive biases and organizational culture that limits diverse perspectives. My next step is to initiate a discussion or workshop within my team to explore these overlooked patterns, focusing on fostering an environment that encourages diverse viewpoints and open communication. This will help enhance collective pattern recognition and drive more informed decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern because it represents an opportunity to enhance processes or gain a strategic advantage, which aligns with my goal of continuous improvement and innovation. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on the tactical identification of patterns rather than addressing systemic issues that lead to these patterns being overlooked, such as communication barriers or a resistance to change within the organization. By shifting my approach, I can work towards fostering an environment that naturally surfaces and addresses these patterns collaboratively."
