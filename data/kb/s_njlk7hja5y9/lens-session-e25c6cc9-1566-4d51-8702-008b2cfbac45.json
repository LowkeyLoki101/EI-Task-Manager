  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an avoidance of confronting an issue that might be complex, uncomfortable, or emotionally challenging. This avoidance could be rooted in fear of the consequences, uncertainty about the solution, or lack of resources to address it. Clearly identifying the specific problem or area of life that you're avoiding can help in taking the first step towards addressing it.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the avoidance might not just be about fear or complexity, but rather an indication of misalignment with your values or priorities. This reframing shifts the focus from avoidance as a negative behavior to a potential sign that the problem may not align with what truly matters to you. Instead of viewing it as a problem to solve, explore whether it's an opportunity to reevaluate and realign your goals or commitments.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, further questions arise: What underlying fears or beliefs might be causing this avoidance? Are there smaller, manageable components of the problem that can be tackled incrementally? Additionally, is there a pattern of avoidance behavior in other areas of life, and what strategies can be implemented to address these tendencies across various contexts? Exploring these questions can lead to a deeper understanding and more effective solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding may be more about misalignment with my values rather than just complexity or fear. As a next step, I'll take time to clearly identify this problem and evaluate how it fits with my core values and priorities. Additionally, I'll break the issue into smaller parts and address them incrementally, while also examining if there's a broader pattern of avoidance in my life that needs attention.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about avoidance because it reflects a recurring pattern of hesitating to confront challenges directly, often due to discomfort or fear of failure. This pattern might stem from a tendency to prioritize immediate comfort over long-term growth, signaling a potential area for personal development in resilience and courageous decision-making. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously choose to break it, focusing on facing issues with a mindset geared towards understanding and growth."
