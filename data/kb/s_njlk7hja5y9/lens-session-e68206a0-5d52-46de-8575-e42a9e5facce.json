  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea in question is to explore the impact of tackling a problem in reverse order, starting from the desired outcome and working backwards to the current state. This approach challenges traditional problem-solving methods, potentially revealing overlooked insights or alternative solutions. By framing the problem backwards, we can identify critical steps or assumptions that may need reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of starting with the end goal, we began by examining the initial conditions and constraints that define the problem? By looking at it from this angle, we might uncover fundamental issues or opportunities that set the stage for more effective solutions. This approach emphasizes understanding the roots of the problem before considering its possible outcomes, potentially leading to a more holistic solution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between outcomes and initial conditions. This prompts further questions such as: How do different starting points affect the path to the desired outcome? What assumptions might be embedded in the traditional forward approach that are challenged when working backwards? Exploring these questions can deepen our understanding of causal relationships and might reveal alternative pathways or strategies that are more efficient or innovative.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify critical steps or assumptions that might be overlooked when using traditional methods. The next action I will take is to map out the desired outcome and trace backwards through each step to the beginning, ensuring that I critically evaluate the necessity and impact of each step. This will help uncover any hidden assumptions or inefficiencies in the current approach.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I am seeking a fresh perspective that might reveal insights traditional methods overlook. This pattern suggests a tendency to challenge conventional thinking, possibly due to a belief that innovative solutions often lie outside standard approaches. By using this meta-lens, I aim to understand whether this recurring pattern leads to more effective solutions or if it sometimes causes unnecessary complexity."
