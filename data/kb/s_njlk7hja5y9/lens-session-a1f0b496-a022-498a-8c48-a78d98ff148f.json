  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an assumption that may be incorrect. I need to pinpoint an assumption I'm currently holding and evaluate its validity. This involves questioning the basis of my belief and considering alternative perspectives or information that might challenge it.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying an assumption, consider the possibility that the entire framework or context in which you operate might be based on outdated or incomplete information. What if the real question is not just about a single assumption but about the foundational beliefs that guide your decisions or actions? By broadening the scope, you might uncover systemic biases or blind spots that affect multiple assumptions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying a recursive lens, new questions emerge: How do I systematically identify and challenge my assumptions? What processes or tools can I implement to regularly evaluate and update my foundational beliefs? Additionally, investigating the broader implications of these assumptions on my interactions and decisions could reveal deeper systemic issues that deserve further research or exploration, such as exploring cognitive biases or seeking diverse perspectives to enrich my understanding.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my foundational beliefs might be based on outdated or incomplete information, affecting multiple assumptions. As a next step, I will implement a regular review process to evaluate and update these beliefs, possibly by setting up a schedule for reflection and seeking diverse perspectives. This action will help ensure my assumptions are aligned with current realities and reduce potential biases.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions because I aim to ensure that my decisions and beliefs are based on accurate and current information. This pattern of questioning assumptions highlights a broader approach of seeking continuous improvement and adaptation, possibly indicating a tendency to challenge the status quo and avoid complacency. By consistently revisiting and reassessing my beliefs, I hope to uncover deeper truths and eliminate biases that might otherwise hinder progress."
