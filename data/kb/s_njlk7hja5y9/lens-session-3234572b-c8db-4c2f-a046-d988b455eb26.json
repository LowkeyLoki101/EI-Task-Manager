  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook that resonates with the target audience for today's marketing content. I see the need to craft a narrative that captures attention quickly and aligns with current trends or challenges that the audience is facing. This requires understanding the audience's interests, pain points, or aspirations to create a narrative that is both engaging and relevant.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on crafting a story hook that resonates with the audience, you viewed your marketing content as an opportunity for the audience to contribute their own stories? Reframe your approach to invite engagement by encouraging the audience to share their experiences or perspectives related to the product or service. This angle not only creates a sense of community but also provides authentic, user-generated content that can be a powerful marketing tool.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific platforms or mediums are best suited for sharing user-generated stories in your marketing strategy? How can you leverage analytics to identify which user-generated content resonates most with your audience? Additionally, what are the best practices for incentivizing audience participation in sharing their stories to ensure a steady stream of engaging content?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to create marketing content that invites the audience to share their personal experiences related to the product or service. The next step is to identify the most effective platforms, such as social media or community forums, to facilitate this engagement. Additionally, I'll develop a strategy for incentivizing participation, perhaps through contests or rewards, and use analytics to track which stories resonate most with the audience, refining the approach based on these insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "You're thinking about this right now because you're aiming to create marketing content that stands out and effectively engages your audience. This pattern of seeking a compelling story hook reflects your habitual focus on storytelling as a core strategy in your marketing efforts. By stepping back, you might realize that you've been consistently prioritizing the crafting of narratives over exploring more interactive or community-driven content, which could diversify and enrich your approach."
