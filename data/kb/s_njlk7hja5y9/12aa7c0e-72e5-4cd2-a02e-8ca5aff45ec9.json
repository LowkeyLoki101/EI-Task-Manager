  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, either independently or through collaborative and technological means, I can generate a set of new, innovative prompts that inspire fresh perspectives and creativity. As a next step, I will experiment with both manual rearrangement and AI-assisted methods to shuffle prompts, and also invite feedback and contributions from others to enrich the process. This dual approach will allow me to evaluate which method yields the most effective and inspiring prompts.",
