  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is exploring the potential outcomes and insights gained from tackling a problem in reverse. By approaching the problem backwards, I am considering starting from the desired outcome and working in reverse to identify the steps needed to achieve it. This approach could reveal overlooked details and alternative pathways that would not be evident when approaching the problem in a traditional, forward manner.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I viewed this problem as an opportunity to enhance my understanding of the underlying system rather than just seeking a solution? By approaching it backwards, I could focus on uncovering the core principles and mechanisms that drive the problem's dynamics. This perspective shift transforms the process into a learning experience that might reveal new strategies or insights applicable to other areas or future challenges.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards raises several questions for deeper investigation: How does understanding the end goal influence the identification of initial steps in a problem-solving process? What methodologies or fields of study already utilize backward problem-solving techniques, and what can be learned from them? Additionally, exploring the psychological and cognitive impacts of reverse problem-solving on creativity and innovation could yield valuable insights for both personal and professional development.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will not only help in identifying alternative pathways and overlooked details but also enhance my understanding of the system's core principles. The next step is to select a specific problem and deliberately apply a reverse problem-solving approach, documenting the process and outcomes to analyze its effectiveness and potential insights. This will provide concrete evidence on the value of this approach and guide further applications.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm considering this approach right now because I'm seeking alternative perspectives to enhance problem-solving skills and uncover new insights. This pattern of exploring problems from unconventional angles is a recurring strategy I employ to deepen my understanding of complex systems and to innovate beyond traditional methods. By consistently challenging conventional approaches, I aim to foster creativity and adaptability in tackling various challenges."
