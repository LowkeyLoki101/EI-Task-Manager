  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain opportunities or risks are consistently overlooked by others in my environment. This could be due to a lack of awareness or differing priorities, but it highlights a potential gap in perception or understanding. By identifying and addressing this gap, I can leverage these insights for strategic advantage or to mitigate potential issues.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the overlooked opportunities or risks as gaps in others' perception, consider them as unique insights that you possess due to your specific experiences or expertise. This perspective shifts the focus from what others are missing to what you uniquely bring to the table. By embracing this distinct viewpoint, you can position yourself as a valuable resource or innovator within your environment, offering fresh perspectives that others may not have considered.",

  "recursiveStep": "What specific experiences or expertise contribute to my ability to see these patterns that others might miss? Are there additional patterns or opportunities that could arise from a deeper exploration of my unique insights? Investigating these questions can help identify new areas for personal development or strategic positioning, potentially leading to broader innovations or solutions in my environment.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my specific experiences and expertise allow me to recognize certain patterns that others may not notice. The next step is to document these insights and analyze how they align with current goals or challenges in my environment. I will also explore potential ways to communicate or implement these insights to create value, positioning myself as a strategic resource or innovator.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because it reflects a recurring theme in my approach to problem-solving and strategic thinkingâ€”identifying what others overlook and leveraging it for advantage. This pattern suggests that I have a tendency to focus on gaps and unique insights, which could stem from a desire to differentiate myself or to provide value through innovation and foresight. By recognizing this pattern, I can be more intentional about how I use these insights to contribute meaningfully and strategically within my environment."
