  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where small, incremental changes and adaptations in a system or process often lead to significant long-term improvements, yet these changes are frequently overlooked by others who focus only on larger, more immediate shifts. This pattern indicates that there is value in paying closer attention to subtle trends and adjustments that accumulate over time to drive meaningful outcomes.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the pattern not as a series of small changes leading to improvements, but as a reflection of a deeper systemic inertia where larger changes are resisted. This angle suggests that the small, incremental adjustments are merely coping mechanisms within a system that inherently resists transformation. By focusing on these subtle shifts, we might be missing the need for more foundational changes that address the root causes of inefficiency or stagnation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Considering the recursive lens, we could ask: What are the underlying factors that cause individuals or organizations to overlook small, incremental changes? Is there a cognitive or cultural bias favoring large, immediate transformations that we need to understand more deeply? Further exploration could involve researching decision-making processes and biases in organizational behavior, as well as investigating how these subtle shifts can be better identified and leveraged for strategic advantage.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the focus on large, immediate changes often overshadows the importance of small, incremental adjustments, which collectively drive significant improvements over time. To address this, my next step will be to conduct research on cognitive and cultural biases in decision-making, focusing on how these biases impact the perception and implementation of incremental changes. Additionally, I'll explore strategies to better identify and leverage these subtle shifts for strategic advantage within organizations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm thinking about this pattern now because I habitually focus on the subtle, incremental aspects of systems, potentially due to a comfort with gradual change over disruptive transformation. This approach might be repeating a pattern where I prioritize stability and gradual improvement over more radical reform, which could limit the scope of solutions I consider. Recognizing this helps me balance the attention I give to both small and large-scale changes, ensuring I don't overlook the potential need for significant systemic shifts."
