  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that collaborating with domain experts will enhance the development of a tailored simulation model, ensuring it meets our specific data needs. As a next step, I will reach out to potential experts and begin evaluating open-source simulation platforms that can be customized to fit our objectives. This approach aims to streamline the process and optimize the generation of relevant and accurate data.",
