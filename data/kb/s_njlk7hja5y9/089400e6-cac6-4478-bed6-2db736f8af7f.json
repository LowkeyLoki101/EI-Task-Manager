  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to the emergence of novel insights by introducing new contexts and connections. The next actionable step is to experiment with different methods of shuffling, such as randomization and thematic grouping, to observe which approach yields the most innovative questions or perspectives. Additionally, I will explore using AI tools to enhance this process, potentially automating and optimizing the generation of valuable new prompts.",
