  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is exploring the potential for generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling your prompts, you aim to discover unexpected connections or perspectives that could lead to innovative thinking or problem-solving approaches. This process encourages breaking out of habitual thought patterns to uncover fresh ideas.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of shuffling your prompts, you looked at them through a different context or lens, such as considering them from the perspective of a different discipline or culture? This might reveal unique insights or patterns that aren't immediately obvious when viewed through your usual framework. By altering the context in which you examine your prompts, you could uncover innovative ideas that may not surface through mere rearrangement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new prompts could be generated if, in addition to shuffling, you integrated prompts from different disciplines or cultural perspectives? How might the process of shuffling be enhanced by incorporating technology, such as using algorithms to identify patterns or themes in the prompts that are shuffled? Exploring these questions could deepen the investigation into how diverse influences and tools can catalyze the creative process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by integrating prompts from different disciplines and cultural perspectives and potentially using technology to identify patterns, I can generate more innovative and diverse ideas than by simply shuffling my own prompts. As a next step, I will experiment with mixing prompts from varied sources and employing a basic algorithm to analyze and group them by emerging themes. This approach will help identify unique connections and insights that could lead to creative breakthroughs.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about shuffling my prompts to explore the potential for new insights because I am seeking ways to break free from my usual patterns of thinking and generate creative ideas. This reflects a pattern of relying on external tools or techniques to stimulate innovation. By recognizing this, I can consciously choose to also develop internal strategies, such as mindfulness or reflection, to enhance my creative thinking process without solely depending on mechanical methods like shuffling."
