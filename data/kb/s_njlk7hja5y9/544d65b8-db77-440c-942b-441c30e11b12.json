  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that procrastination serves as a signal pointing towards tasks misaligned with my interests or overly complex ones that need simplification. My next step is to create a list of tasks I frequently procrastinate on and analyze them for common patterns or themes.
