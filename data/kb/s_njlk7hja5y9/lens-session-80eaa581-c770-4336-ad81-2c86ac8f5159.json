  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is determining the type of simulation that can be designed and executed to generate new and useful data. This involves identifying the specific needs or gaps in the current data set, defining the parameters and variables that the simulation should incorporate, and selecting a simulation model or tool that aligns with these requirements to produce relevant and actionable insights.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through simulations, consider reframing the problem by asking: \"What insights or decisions are we aiming to support with new data, and how can a simulation be designed to test different scenarios or hypotheses?\" By shifting the perspective to the end goals and potential applications of the data, you can better identify the types of simulations that will yield the most valuable information. This approach emphasizes the purpose behind data generation and guides the design process toward meaningful outcomes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific scenarios or variables are currently underexplored or poorly understood in our field, and how can simulating these aspects provide novel insights? Additionally, what existing data or simulations can be leveraged or enhanced to address these gaps, and what are the potential limitations or unintended consequences of the simulation outcomes that need further investigation? These questions can guide deeper research into the design and implementation of a simulation that not only generates new data but also enhances our understanding of the underlying system.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to design a simulation focused on underexplored scenarios or variables that are critical to our field, such as those that involve dynamic interactions or complex systems. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive review of existing data and simulation models to identify gaps and opportunities for enhancement. I will then develop a detailed simulation plan that outlines the objectives, parameters, and methodologies to ensure the generation of meaningful and actionable new data.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because there is a need to explore and understand potential scenarios that are not captured by the existing data, aiming to enhance decision-making processes. The pattern I'm repeating involves focusing on data generation as an end in itself, rather than as a means to achieve specific insights or address particular questions. By using a meta-lens, I can shift my approach to prioritize the purpose and application of the data, ensuring the simulation is aligned with strategic objectives."
