  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "To frame the problem directly, I see the need to identify a specific scenario or process that requires new data for analysis or decision-making. The goal is to design a simulation that accurately models this scenario, allowing us to generate relevant and useful data that can fill current gaps or explore potential outcomes. By clarifying the specific area of interest or decision context, we can determine the parameters and variables necessary for creating an effective simulation.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from the perspective of a creative exploration, instead of focusing solely on filling existing data gaps, we could view the simulation as a tool for innovation. This approach encourages us to simulate hypothetical futures or scenarios that have not been considered before, thereby generating data that could lead to novel insights or disruptive opportunities. By shifting our focus to what could be possible rather than just what is currently needed, we open up possibilities for unexpected discoveries and strategic foresight.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What emerging technologies or methodologies could enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the simulation? How can we incorporate feedback loops within the simulation to continuously refine and improve its predictive capabilities? Additionally, what ethical considerations should we explore in relation to the data generated, especially when simulating scenarios that could impact real-world decision-making or affect individuals and communities?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to create a simulation that models future climate scenarios and their impacts on urban infrastructure. As a next step, I will gather experts from fields like climate science, urban planning, and data analytics to define the parameters and variables for this simulation. This collaboration will ensure the model is both comprehensive and aligned with current technological capabilities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I realize that my current focus on simulations is driven by a pattern of seeking control and predictability in decision-making. This approach often leads me to prioritize structured data generation over embracing uncertainty and potential chaos, which can limit creative thinking. Recognizing this pattern, I should balance my analytical tendencies with a willingness to explore more open-ended or speculative scenarios, allowing for innovative insights and adaptability to unforeseen changes."
