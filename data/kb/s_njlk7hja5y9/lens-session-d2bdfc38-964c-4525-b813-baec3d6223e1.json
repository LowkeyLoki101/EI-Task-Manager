  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely a challenging or uncomfortable situation in my life that requires attention but feels overwhelming or uncertain. This could be a personal issue, such as a relationship conflict or a career decision, that I haven't yet confronted or resolved. Addressing it directly is necessary to move forward and alleviate the underlying stress or anxiety it may be causing.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding is not just a source of stress but an opportunity for growth and learning? By reframing the situation as a chance to develop resilience or gain new insights, I can approach the issue with curiosity rather than fear. This shift in perspective might make the problem seem less daunting and more like a challenge to embrace, opening up possibilities for positive change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, the problem I'm avoiding might lead to questions about underlying patterns in my behavior or decision-making. Is there a recurring theme to the issues I tend to avoid, such as fear of confrontation or a lack of confidence in decision-making? Further investigation could involve examining past situations where avoidance led to negative outcomes, and how addressing similar issues earlier might have produced different results. This could lead to exploring strategies for breaking avoidance habits or building skills to handle such problems more effectively in the future.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding revolves around a recurring pattern in my behavior, such as avoidance of confrontation. As a next step, I will pinpoint a specific situation that exemplifies this pattern and confront it directly, using it as a test case to practice new strategies for resolution. This action will help me break the habit of avoidance and potentially gain insights into handling similar issues more effectively in the future.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about avoiding problems because it highlights a recurring pattern in my life where I tend to sidestep difficult issues instead of confronting them head-on. This avoidance may stem from a desire to maintain comfort and stability, but ultimately it prevents me from resolving underlying stressors. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously work on breaking it by approaching challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, thereby fostering personal development and resilience."
