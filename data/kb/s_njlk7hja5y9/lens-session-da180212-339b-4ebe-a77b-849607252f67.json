  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that all my current beliefs and decisions are based on accurate and complete information. This assumption may be flawed if I have overlooked potential biases or gaps in my understanding. Addressing this assumption requires identifying and questioning specific beliefs that could be based on outdated or incorrect information.",
  "reframeStep": "From another perspective, consider that the assumption about having complete and accurate information could be reinterpreted as an opportunity for growth and learning. Instead of viewing potential gaps in understanding as flaws, they could be seen as avenues to explore new insights and knowledge. This reframing encourages a proactive approach to seeking out diverse perspectives and questioning existing beliefs to enhance one's understanding continuously.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "A recursive exploration of the assumption that my beliefs and decisions are based on complete and accurate information could lead to further questions such as: What specific areas of my knowledge are most susceptible to bias or misinformation? How can I systematically identify and address these gaps? Additionally, it prompts an investigation into the sources and methodologies I rely on for informationâ€”are they diverse and credible enough, or do they reinforce existing biases? Exploring these areas can help construct a more robust framework for continuous learning and adaptation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my beliefs and decisions might not be based on entirely accurate or complete information due to potential biases or overlooked gaps. As a next step, I will actively seek out diverse perspectives and engage with new sources of information to challenge and refine my current understanding. This proactive approach will help identify specific areas of bias or misinformation and enhance my decision-making process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about the assumption that my beliefs and decisions are based on complete and accurate information because I'm seeking to improve my decision-making process and avoid potential biases. This reflects a pattern of wanting to be thorough and self-aware in my approach, ensuring that I'm not operating on outdated or incorrect information. By consistently questioning my assumptions, I aim to cultivate a mindset that values continuous learning and adaptability."
