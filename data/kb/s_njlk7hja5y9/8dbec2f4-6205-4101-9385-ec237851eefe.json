  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that simulations should be selected based on the specific type of data needed and the context in which it will be used. My next step is to clearly define the objectives and data requirements by consulting with stakeholders or domain experts. Following this, I will research existing simulation frameworks and tools that align with these objectives, while also considering alternative data generation methods to ensure the most efficient and effective approach is chosen.",
