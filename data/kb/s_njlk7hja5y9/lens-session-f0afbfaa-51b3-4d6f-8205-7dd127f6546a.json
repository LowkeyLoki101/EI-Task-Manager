  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is about exploring creativity and novelty through the randomization of existing prompts. By shuffling your own prompts, you can generate new questions or ideas that may lead to unexpected insights or solutions, fostering a fresh perspective and breaking free from habitual thinking patterns. This approach encourages innovation and can reveal connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on the prompts themselves, we reframe the exercise as an exploration of underlying themes or motivations behind the prompts? By examining why certain prompts were created and their intended outcomes, shuffling them might reveal not just new questions but also deeper insights into your creative process and personal growth. This shift in perspective emphasizes understanding the rationale behind your prompts, providing a more introspective approach to generating innovation and self-discovery.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling your prompts, a new question that emerges is: How do the connections between different prompts influence my thinking patterns or biases? Additionally, it prompts an investigation into whether certain themes consistently appear, revealing unconscious priorities or interests. Further exploration could involve analyzing the emotional or cognitive responses elicited by the newly formed prompts, potentially leading to deeper insights into personal values or creative blocks.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can uncover new patterns or connections, providing insights into my creative preferences and biases. The next step is to actually shuffle my prompts and document the new combinations and my reactions to them. This exercise will help identify recurring themes or unexpected ideas, which can inform future creative projects or personal development goals.",
