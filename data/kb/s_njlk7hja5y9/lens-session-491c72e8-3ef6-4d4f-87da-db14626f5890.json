  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea framed here is the exploration of unexpected discoveries or findings that could be surprising. This involves identifying areas or elements in one's environment, knowledge, or experiences where assumptions may not align with reality, leading to unexpected outcomes. The focus is on uncovering these surprising elements to gain new insights or challenge existing perspectives.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from a different perspective involves considering what surprising discoveries might reveal about oneself rather than the external world. Instead of focusing on what might be surprising in one's surroundings, consider what unexpected revelations about personal beliefs, biases, or capabilities could emerge. This shift in perspective emphasizes introspection and personal growth, where the surprise lies in uncovering hidden aspects of one's identity or potential.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive aspect of the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to further inquiries about the potential layers of surprise. What foundational beliefs or assumptions might these surprising discoveries challenge, and how could these insights lead to even deeper revelations about other aspects of life or knowledge? Additionally, what systemic or interconnected issues could be unveiled by exploring these surprises, prompting a reevaluation of broader contexts or systems? These questions warrant deeper investigation to understand the cascading effects of unexpected findings.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries often challenge foundational beliefs or reveal hidden personal insights. As a next step, I will actively seek out environments or experiences that push me out of my comfort zone, documenting any unexpected insights or revelations. This process will not only help uncover surprises but also facilitate personal growth and a deeper understanding of my internal biases.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about the potential for surprising discoveries because it reflects a pattern of curiosity and a desire for growth and understanding. This approach often involves challenging existing assumptions and seeking out hidden or overlooked aspects of both the external world and my internal landscape. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously cultivate openness to new experiences and insights, fostering continuous learning and self-awareness."
