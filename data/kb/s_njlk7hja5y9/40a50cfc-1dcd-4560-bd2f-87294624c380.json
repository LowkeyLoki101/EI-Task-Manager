  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or outdated information. As a next step, I will conduct a structured review of my core assumptions, possibly using a checklist or framework to systematically evaluate their validity. Additionally, I will seek feedback from others to gain diverse perspectives that could reveal any blind spots in my reasoning.",
