  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain inefficiencies or overlooked opportunities consistently arise in a specific context, but others around me seem to overlook them. This could be due to a lack of perspective, entrenched habits, or simply not prioritizing these observations. By clearly identifying and communicating these patterns, I can help others recognize and address them effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I keep observing is not actually being missed by others, but rather is being perceived differently due to varying priorities or experiences? By considering that others may have insights or constraints I'm unaware of, I can approach the situation with more curiosity and openness, which may lead to more collaborative and innovative solutions. This shift in perspective can help me engage with colleagues more constructively, fostering a dialogue that uncovers underlying reasons for these inefficiencies and overlooked opportunities.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge: How might my own biases or experiences shape the patterns I observe, possibly leading me to overlook other critical aspects? What tools or methods could I use to validate whether these patterns are genuinely overlooked by others, or if they are being addressed in ways I haven't considered? Further investigation into collaborative tools or frameworks for team discussions could provide deeper insights into how different perspectives converge or diverge, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the patterns I observe may not be entirely overlooked by others, but rather understood differently due to diverse perspectives and priorities. As a next step, I will organize a team meeting to openly discuss these patterns and invite feedback, aiming to collaboratively explore and validate these observations. This dialogue will help uncover any hidden insights or constraints, fostering a more comprehensive approach to addressing these inefficiencies and opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because I have a tendency to focus on identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement, which may be driven by a desire to enhance processes and create value. This approach reflects a pattern of assuming the role of a problem-solver or innovator. By recognizing this mindset, I can be more conscious of how it influences my interactions and consider how to balance my perspective with the diverse insights of others, fostering a more collaborative environment."
