  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea to frame here is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could arise in a given situation or area of interest. This involves considering scenarios or information that defy current assumptions or challenge existing knowledge. By outlining what specifically would be surprising, you can better prepare for or anticipate these unforeseen elements in your research or exploration.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what would surprise you, consider what underlying assumptions or biases you hold that might be challenged by unexpected findings. Reframe the question to explore how these discoveries could shift your perspective, alter your approach, or even inspire new lines of inquiry. By concentrating on the potential impact of surprises rather than the surprises themselves, you open yourself to broader possibilities and insights beyond the initial scope.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens on the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to questions about the nature of surprise itselfâ€”what are the cognitive processes that define something as surprising, and how do they differ across individuals or cultures? This could further prompt an investigation into how surprise influences learning and memory, potentially leading to research on how harnessing surprise can enhance creativity or problem-solving. Additionally, examining how past surprises have shaped current beliefs and assumptions might reveal patterns that can predict future unexpected findings.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that identifying what would surprise me involves examining and challenging my own assumptions and biases. As a next step, I will actively seek out diverse perspectives and engage with unfamiliar or counterintuitive ideas in my area of interest. This action will allow me to identify potential surprises and broaden my understanding, ultimately enhancing my research or exploration process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking to uncover gaps in my knowledge or assumptions that could lead to significant insights or breakthroughs. This pattern involves a curiosity-driven approach, aiming to challenge and expand my current understanding. By stepping back, I recognize that focusing on surprises not only sharpens my awareness of the unexpected but also cultivates a mindset that values adaptability and continuous learning."
