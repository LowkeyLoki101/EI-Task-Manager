  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is centered around identifying unexpected discoveries or realizations that could arise in familiar or unfamiliar contexts. It's about uncovering elements that challenge assumptions or preconceived notions, leading to new insights or perspectives. This involves examining areas where hidden information or unanticipated connections could exist, prompting a reassessment of what is known or assumed.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this question not from a standpoint of personal discovery, but from considering what might surprise others or society at large if it were found? By shifting the focus outward, I can explore broader implications and societal norms that might be challenged by unexpected findings. This perspective emphasizes the impact of surprise on a collective level, prompting a reevaluation of shared assumptions and cultural understandings.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the societal assumptions or norms that could be challenged by unexpected discoveries, and how might these revelations reshape cultural narratives? Additionally, how do unexpected findings influence scientific or technological advancements, and what new ethical considerations might arise from these surprises? These questions warrant deeper investigation to understand the broader impact on collective knowledge and societal progress.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries that challenge societal norms or assumptions often lead to significant shifts in cultural narratives and can drive progress in science and technology. The next step is to identify specific areas or fields where these surprises are likely to occur and analyze their potential impact on society. I'll start by researching recent technological or scientific breakthroughs that have disrupted conventional thinking and consider their broader implications.",
