  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a simulation that can generate new, relevant data for our needs. This involves determining the specific data gaps or questions we aim to address and selecting a simulation model capable of producing reliable results. We need to clarify the domain and parameters of the simulation to ensure it aligns with our objectives.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data, consider reframing the question to explore how existing data could inform the design of a simulation. What insights can be gathered from analyzing current datasets that might highlight gaps or opportunities for simulations? This shift in perspective allows us to leverage the data we already have to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the simulation we choose to run.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific criteria and parameters that will guide the selection of a simulation model? How can we ensure that the simulation outputs are validated and accurately reflect real-world scenarios? Additionally, what are the potential technological or methodological advancements that could enhance the robustness and credibility of the simulation results? These questions merit deeper research to ensure the chosen simulation effectively meets our data generation objectives.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by analyzing existing datasets, we can identify specific gaps or questions that a simulation could address. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of current data to pinpoint these areas and then select or design a simulation model tailored to these needs. I will also explore technological advancements that could enhance simulation accuracy, ensuring the results are reflective of real-world scenarios.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now to address a pressing need for new data that can inform decision-making or fill specific knowledge gaps. A pattern I might be repeating is jumping to the solution of running a simulation without fully exploring or utilizing existing data resources. By stepping back, I can ensure that I am not overlooking the potential insights or foundational knowledge that current data could provide, which might lead to more effective and informed simulation design."
