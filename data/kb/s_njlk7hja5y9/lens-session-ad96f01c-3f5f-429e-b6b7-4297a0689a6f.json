  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as an opportunity to explore solutions from the end result backwards to the starting point. By identifying the desired outcome first, I can work in reverse to uncover the necessary steps and processes that lead to that outcome. This approach might reveal overlooked assumptions or steps in the original forward-thinking process.",
  "reframeStep": "Approaching the problem backwards can be reframed as an exercise in reverse engineering, where the focus shifts from problem-solving to problem-deconstructing. This perspective emphasizes understanding the underlying mechanisms and dependencies that produce the desired outcome. By deconstructing the end result, I can identify critical junctures or decision points that are essential to achieving success, potentially unveiling innovative pathways that aren't apparent in a traditional forward approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the idea of approaching a problem backwards raises new questions such as: What are the specific assumptions underlying the traditional forward approach that we might not question otherwise? How can we identify potential biases or gaps in our understanding by deconstructing the outcome? Additionally, it invites deeper investigation into whether this reverse methodology could be systematically applied to other problems across different fields, potentially leading to a broader framework for reverse engineering solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching problems backwards can uncover overlooked steps and assumptions by focusing on the desired outcome first. The next actionable step is to apply this reverse engineering method to a specific problem, mapping out the desired end result and tracing backwards to identify the necessary steps and decisions needed to achieve it. This exercise will help evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and determine its applicability to other problems.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards right now because it challenges my usual linear problem-solving approach and encourages creativity and innovation. By considering this method, I'm likely repeating a pattern of seeking alternative perspectives when conventional strategies feel limited or insufficient. This reflects an ongoing effort to refine my problem-solving skills by incorporating diverse methodologies that could lead to more comprehensive and effective solutions."
