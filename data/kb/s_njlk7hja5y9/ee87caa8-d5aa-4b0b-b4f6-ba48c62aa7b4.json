  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts, I can uncover recurring patterns and themes that highlight my cognitive biases and interests. As a next step, I will document the prompts generated from this exercise and analyze them for themes or patterns over time. This will help me identify any biases or gaps in my thinking, and develop targeted strategies to expand my knowledge and creativity.",
