  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is how to effectively approach a problem by reversing the usual process. By considering the outcome first and working backwards, you can identify the necessary steps and prerequisites that lead to the solution. This approach could reveal overlooked dependencies or simplify complex processes by focusing on the final goal.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of thinking about approaching the problem backwards, we considered approaching it laterally? By exploring parallel or tangential avenues that might not seem directly related, we could uncover innovative solutions or insights that we wouldn't find by merely reversing steps. This perspective shift encourages creative problem-solving and could lead to unexpected, yet effective, pathways to the desired outcome.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, we could ask: What are the potential limitations or challenges of approaching a problem backwards, and how might these be mitigated? Additionally, what other unconventional methodologies, like lateral or circular thinking, could complement or enhance the backwards approach? Further investigation could explore examples where a backwards approach has been successfully implemented and analyze what factors contributed to its success.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can illuminate critical steps and dependencies often overlooked in forward planning. As a next step, I will test this hypothesis by selecting a specific problem and outlining the desired outcome first, then mapping out the preceding steps needed to achieve it. Additionally, I will explore lateral thinking approaches in parallel to identify any innovative solutions that may arise, comparing the effectiveness of each method.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I'm seeking a fresh perspective that might reveal hidden aspects or solutions. This pattern of reversing or rethinking traditional approaches indicates a desire to break free from conventional problem-solving methods and explore alternative strategies. By questioning established processes, I'm aiming to enhance creativity and adaptability in addressing challenges."
