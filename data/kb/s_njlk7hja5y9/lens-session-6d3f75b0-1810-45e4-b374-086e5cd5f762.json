  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying key trends and changes in your industry that could impact your business or professional growth. This involves staying informed about technological advancements, regulatory changes, market dynamics, and consumer behavior shifts. By focusing on these aspects, you can anticipate challenges and opportunities, allowing you to adapt and remain competitive.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on external trends and changes, consider reframing the question to assess how your own business or skill set can drive change within the industry. What unique capabilities do you have that could influence the market or set new standards? By shifting your perspective from being a passive observer to an active participant or innovator, you might uncover opportunities to lead industry transformation rather than just adapt to it.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of recursive exploration, consider diving deeper into specific trends you've identified by asking questions such as: What are the underlying causes driving these trends? How might these trends evolve over time, and what secondary effects could they have on the industry? Additionally, investigate how emerging technologies or regulatory changes could intersect with these trends in unexpected ways, potentially creating new opportunities or threats. Conducting thorough research into these areas could reveal insights that are not immediately apparent, allowing you to develop a more comprehensive strategy for navigating future industry landscapes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by becoming an active participant rather than just an observer in my industry, I can leverage my unique capabilities to drive change and capitalize on emerging trends. My next step is to conduct in-depth research into specific industry trends and examine how these trends could evolve, intersect with new technologies, or be influenced by regulatory changes. This will involve setting aside dedicated time each week to review industry reports, attend relevant webinars, and engage in discussions with peers to gather diverse insights and perspectives.",
