  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying an engaging story hook for creating effective marketing content. The focus should be on understanding the target audience's interests and current trends to craft a narrative that captures attention and resonates with their needs or aspirations. The goal is to find a unique angle or emotional connection that will make the marketing content stand out and drive engagement.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the target audience's interests or trends, consider reframing the problem by looking at your brand's unique values or mission. What story hook can you create that not only captures attention but also authentically aligns with your brand's core message? By emphasizing your brand's unique perspective or journey, you might uncover a story hook that differentiates your content in a compelling way.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively prompts us to ask: How can we continuously adapt our story hooks to remain relevant as market dynamics and audience preferences evolve? Additionally, it raises the question of how we can build a feedback loop into our content strategy to gather insights and refine our narrative approach over time. Investigating these areas could lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that sustain a brand's storytelling effectiveness in the long run.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to use a story hook that highlights the unique journey or values of the brand, aligning it with a current trend or audience interest for greater impact. The next step is to identify one or two key brand values or aspects of its journey that are both compelling and authentic. I will then brainstorm how these can be creatively linked to a trending topic or audience interest to craft a narrative that is both engaging and true to the brand's mission.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because crafting a compelling story hook is crucial for standing out in a saturated market and engaging the audience effectively. A pattern I may be repeating is focusing too much on external factors like trends and audience interests, rather than integrating the brand's unique narrative and values. By recognizing this, I can shift towards a more balanced approach that combines audience engagement with authentic brand storytelling."
