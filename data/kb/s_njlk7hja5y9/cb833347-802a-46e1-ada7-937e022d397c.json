  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that running an agent-based simulation could effectively address gaps related to individual behavioral patterns within the current data set. The next step is to identify the specific variables and parameters that have the most uncertainty and design the simulation to focus on these areas. Additionally, I will explore integrating machine learning techniques to enhance the simulation's predictive accuracy and ensure ethical considerations are factored into the design process.",
