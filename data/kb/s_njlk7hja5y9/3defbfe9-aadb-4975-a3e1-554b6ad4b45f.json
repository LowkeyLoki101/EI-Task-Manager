  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by shuffling existing prompts and considering their underlying themes, I can generate novel prompts that lead to fresh insights and creative ideas. The next step is to manually shuffle a set of my prompts, paying attention to their original contexts and purposes, and then evaluate the new combinations based on criteria such as originality and relevance. Additionally, exploring automated tools or AI assistance for this shuffling process could further enhance the diversity and creativity of the prompts generated.",
