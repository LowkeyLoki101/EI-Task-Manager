  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem centers around self-reflection and awareness, specifically identifying important questions that have been neglected over time. The task is to pinpoint a question that is crucial for personal growth or understanding but hasn't been considered recently. This involves introspection to assess areas of life that may need attention or reassessment.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question you haven't asked yourself, consider the perspectives or areas of your life that you've consistently overlooked. What elements of your routine or assumptions have gone unquestioned? By shifting the focus from a question to an unexplored perspective, you might uncover areas that need attention or offer new insights for growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, consider what habitual patterns or thought processes have gone unquestioned for a while and why they remain unexamined. What are the underlying beliefs or assumptions that have persisted without scrutiny? Delving deeper, explore how these unattended areas might be influencing your decisions or emotional well-being, and whether there are alternative perspectives that could lead to more balanced or fulfilling life choices.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I have been neglecting to examine certain habitual patterns and assumptions in my life, possibly because they are deeply ingrained and not immediately visible. As a next step, I will set aside time for structured reflection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to consciously explore these overlooked areas and challenge any unexamined beliefs. This approach aims to uncover new insights and foster personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there's an underlying need for self-improvement and ensuring that I'm not becoming complacent in my personal growth journey. The pattern I might be repeating is neglecting regular, intentional self-reflection, which can lead to overlooking important aspects of my life. By recognizing this tendency, I can make a conscious effort to regularly engage in comprehensive self-assessment, ensuring that I'm addressing all facets of my life and growth."
