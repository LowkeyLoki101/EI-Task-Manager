  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying what new insights or ideas can be generated by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling the prompts, the goal is to explore novel combinations that might lead to unexpected or innovative questions and solutions. This exercise seeks to break out of conventional patterns and stimulate creative thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from the perspective of serendipity, consider the act of shuffling prompts not just as a method for generating new questions but as a way to embrace the unexpected and discover hidden connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. What if the purpose of shuffling is less about the outcome and more about cultivating a mindset open to surprise and curiosity? This shift in perspective encourages a playful exploration of prompts, where the focus is on enjoying the process of discovery rather than seeking specific results.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, we might ask: How do certain combinations of prompts influence our thought processes differently? What patterns or themes emerge when prompts are shuffled multiple times, and how can these patterns inform our understanding of creativity? Further investigation could delve into whether repeated shuffling leads to the discovery of truly novel insights, or if it eventually reveals underlying biases in the way we construct prompts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling prompts, we can uncover new connections and themes that catalyze creative thinking. The next step is to actively engage in this exercise by randomly rearranging a set of prompts and documenting any novel insights or questions that arise. This process should be repeated multiple times to observe patterns and refine the approach to leveraging prompt shuffling as a tool for creativity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now to break free from habitual thinking patterns and to foster a more creative and open mindset. This approach reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and innovation through randomness, embracing the unknown as a catalyst for new insights. By applying this meta-lens, I acknowledge the importance of flexibility and adaptability in my thinking process, encouraging a mindset that values the journey of exploration over predetermined outcomes."
