  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a type of simulation that can effectively generate new and useful data for our purposes. We need to consider the goals of the simulation, the kind of data we wish to produce, and the resources available to execute this simulation. By clarifying these factors, we can determine the most appropriate simulation model to use.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new data through a simulation, consider how existing data can be enhanced or combined with simulated data to yield deeper insights. What if we run a simulation that tests different scenarios using current data as a foundation, thereby generating new data through variations and extrapolations? This approach could help us uncover patterns or predict outcomes that haven't been explored yet.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific types of scenarios or variations should we test in our simulation to generate the most impactful new data? How can we ensure that the simulated data integrates seamlessly with existing datasets to enhance validity and reliability? These questions call for deeper investigation into the simulation's design parameters and the methodologies for merging simulated results with real-world data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that we should design a simulation that models various scenarios based on our existing data, focusing on parameters that have the potential to significantly impact our outcomes. As a next step, I will outline a detailed plan for the simulation, including the selection of key variables to manipulate, the methodologies for data integration, and the tools needed to execute the simulation effectively. This will help us generate new data that is both relevant and actionable.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about running a simulation to create new data because there is a need to explore unexplored scenarios or predict future outcomes that our current data does not cover. This pattern of approaching problem-solving with simulations suggests a reliance on computational methods to fill data gaps, which may be due to a recurring need to innovate or validate hypotheses in a controlled environment. By recognizing this pattern, I can assess whether there are alternate methods, such as leveraging expert insights or real-world experimentation, that might complement or enhance the simulation approach."
