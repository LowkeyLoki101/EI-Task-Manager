  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely something that causes discomfort or anxiety, such as a challenging task, a difficult conversation, or an unresolved issue in my personal or professional life. It may be affecting my productivity or well-being, and I need to identify it clearly to address it effectively. Recognizing this avoidance is the first step toward finding a solution or taking necessary action.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the problem you're avoiding as an opportunity for growth rather than a source of discomfort. Instead of viewing it as a hurdle, see it as a potential learning experience that could lead to personal or professional development. This shift in perspective might reduce the anxiety associated with the issue and motivate you to tackle it with curiosity and openness.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying fears or beliefs are causing me to avoid thinking about this problem? Are there patterns in my behavior where I consistently avoid certain types of challenges or tasks? Exploring these questions might reveal deeper insights into my avoidance tendencies and prompt further investigation into how I can develop better coping strategies and resilience.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a problem that involves a challenging conversation or a task that feels overwhelming. The next step is to identify one specific issue that I've been procrastinating on and set aside time to address it directly, perhaps by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. I will schedule a time this week to tackle this problem, using the approach of viewing it as a growth opportunity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem right now because I've noticed a pattern of avoidance that tends to surface when facing tasks or situations that challenge my comfort zone. This pattern of avoidance might be rooted in a fear of failure or conflict, and by acknowledging this tendency, I can focus on developing strategies to break this cycle, such as setting small, achievable goals or seeking support from others to address the issue head-on."
