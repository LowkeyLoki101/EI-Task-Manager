  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may not be fully aligned with available evidence or alternative perspectives. The next step is to systematically identify these assumptions and test them using a structured approach, such as conducting research on related topics or engaging in discussions with others to gain diverse perspectives. This action will help refine my assumptions and enhance my decision-making process.",
