  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected elements or discoveries within a given context. I see the need to explore areas or situations where surprises are likely to occur, such as hidden patterns, overlooked data, or unconventional outcomes. The challenge is to pinpoint specific scenarios or environments where these surprises could have a meaningful impact.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the element of surprise itself, consider approaching the trigger from the angle of curiosity and exploration. What if you framed the question as \"What areas or subjects am I not currently aware of that could expand my understanding or reveal new insights?\" This shifts the focus from merely being surprised to actively seeking out new knowledge and perspectives that have the potential to transform your thinking or approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge: What methodologies or tools could help me identify these surprising elements more effectively? How can I continuously integrate the practice of seeking surprise into my daily work or learning routine? Additionally, investigating the broader implications of these surprises on my field or personal growth could reveal deeper insights and inspire innovative approaches or solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas I haven't yet explored or in data I haven't fully analyzed. As a next step, I will prioritize allocating time each week to explore new topics or revisit overlooked data sets with fresh analytical tools. This approach will help integrate surprise-seeking into my routine, fostering continuous learning and innovation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger because it challenges me to step outside my current understanding and confront my biases or blind spots. The pattern I notice in my approach is a tendency to look for surprises only within familiar frameworks or areas of comfort, rather than broadening my exploration to include unfamiliar or uncharted territories. By applying the meta-lens, I can intentionally disrupt this pattern and foster a mindset that embraces the unknown, encouraging deeper learning and innovation."
