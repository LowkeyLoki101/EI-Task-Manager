  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as identifying a compelling narrative that will resonate with the target audience and capture their attention. The story hook needs to be relevant to current trends or issues, emotionally engaging, and aligned with the brand's message or product offering. The goal is to find a unique angle that differentiates the content from competitors and encourages audience interaction or conversion.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on crafting a narrative that captures attention, you approached the story hook by directly involving your audience in its creation? By inviting your target audience to share their personal experiences or challenges related to your product or industry, you could co-create a narrative that not only resonates deeply but also builds a community around shared stories. This angle shifts the focus from broadcasting a message to fostering a dialogue, potentially leading to more authentic engagement and sustained interest.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the idea of co-creating narratives with the audience, new questions emerge: How can technology, such as social media platforms or interactive tools, be leveraged to facilitate this collaborative storytelling process? What metrics or feedback mechanisms can be established to evaluate the effectiveness of audience-driven content versus traditional marketing approaches? Additionally, deeper research could investigate successful case studies of brands that have effectively engaged their audience in narrative creation and the long-term impacts on brand loyalty and community building.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that involving the audience in the creation of the story hook can lead to more authentic and engaging marketing content. The next step is to design an interactive campaign that invites audience participation, perhaps through a social media challenge or a user-generated content contest. I'll also identify and implement metrics to track engagement levels and the campaign's impact on brand perception and community growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By using the meta-lens, I'm examining why I am focused on finding a compelling story hook right now. This focus likely stems from a recurring pattern of seeking unique and effective ways to engage and convert an audience amidst a competitive content landscape. This approach may also reflect a habitual emphasis on innovation and differentiation in content creation to maintain relevance and captivate the audience's interest."
