  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is centered around identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that would challenge my current understanding or assumptions. This involves recognizing areas where my knowledge is limited or where I hold strong, potentially unexamined beliefs. By explicitly seeking out what might surprise me, I can pinpoint opportunities for learning and growth that I might otherwise overlook.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the question: \"What if what would surprise me is actually a blind spot in my knowledge or assumptions?\" This reframing suggests that surprises aren't just anomalies; they are indicators of gaps in understanding or missed connections. By actively seeking out these blind spots, I can focus on areas that need attention and potentially transform unexpected discoveries into valuable insights.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the question \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" through a recursive lens, we can delve deeper into identifying underlying assumptions or biases that might be influencing our expectations. This prompts further investigation into why certain outcomes or discoveries would be surprising, potentially revealing broader patterns or systemic issues in our thinking. Additionally, it invites questioning whether similar surprises have occurred before and what lessons were learned, suggesting a deeper analysis of historical patterns of surprise to uncover persistent gaps in knowledge or understanding.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often reveal blind spots or assumptions in my understanding. The next step is to actively seek out information or perspectives that challenge my current beliefs, possibly through engaging with diverse sources or consulting experts in unfamiliar fields. This approach will help uncover areas for growth and ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.",
