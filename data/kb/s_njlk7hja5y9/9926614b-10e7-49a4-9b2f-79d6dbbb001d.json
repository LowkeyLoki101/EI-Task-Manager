  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions might be based on outdated information or personal biases that I've not yet recognized. As a next step, I'll engage in a feedback session with peers or mentors to gain external perspectives on my assumptions. Additionally, I'll conduct a self-audit using a structured framework to systematically evaluate and challenge these assumptions, ensuring that any identified biases are addressed and corrected.",
