  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption I'm making is that AI will positively transform the energy sector by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. If I consider the reverse, that AI might introduce new inefficiencies or costs, the outcome might involve increased scrutiny on AI implementations, leading to more robust frameworks for assessing AI's impact and ensuring it aligns with energy goals. This shift in perspective could drive a more cautious and measured approach to AI adoption in the sector.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of viewing AI as a transformative force in the energy sector, we considered it as a complementary tool that supplements human decision-making rather than replaces it? This perspective could lead to a greater emphasis on developing hybrid systems where AI and human expertise work in tandem, potentially resulting in solutions that are more adaptable and resilient to complex challenges in the energy sector. By reframing AI as a supportive partner rather than a replacement, we might foster more inclusive and collaborative innovation processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions that emerge include: What are the specific inefficiencies or costs that AI could introduce in the energy sector? How can we develop robust frameworks to assess and mitigate these potential downsides? Further research could involve examining case studies where AI implementation in energy has led to unexpected challenges, as well as investigating best practices for integrating AI with human expertise to enhance decision-making and system resilience.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that AI in the energy sector should be approached as a complement to human expertise rather than a standalone solution. The next step is to conduct a detailed analysis of case studies where AI has been integrated with human decision-making in the energy sector, identifying both successes and challenges. This research will inform the development of guidelines for creating hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both AI and human expertise.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I'm currently examining the broader implications of my assumptions about AI in the energy sector, specifically focusing on how they shape my expectations and decisions. This pattern of questioning assumptions and considering their reversals may reflect a tendency to challenge the status quo and seek a more balanced understanding, ensuring that my approach to AI is both innovative and cautious. This meta-level reflection encourages continuous learning and adaptation, promoting a more nuanced and flexible engagement with AI technologies in complex fields like energy."
