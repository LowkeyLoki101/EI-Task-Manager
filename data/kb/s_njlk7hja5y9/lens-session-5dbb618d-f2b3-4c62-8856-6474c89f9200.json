  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to explore the problem from a different angle by starting with the desired outcome and working in reverse. This approach involves identifying the final goal and then deconstructing the steps needed to reach that point, essentially reverse-engineering the solution. By framing the problem in this way, I can identify potential oversights in the original approach and uncover alternative pathways to the solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem as an opportunity to start from the desired outcome and work backwards allows for a more goal-oriented perspective. By visualizing the end result first, you can better assess the necessary steps and resources needed to achieve it, potentially uncovering more efficient or innovative solutions. This reverse approach could also highlight any assumptions or constraints that need reevaluation, leading to a more comprehensive and effective strategy.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards raises new questions such as: What assumptions underpin the current approach, and how might reversing the sequence of steps challenge these assumptions? Additionally, exploring this backwards methodology further could involve researching case studies or frameworks where reverse-engineering has led to successful outcomes, offering insights into its broader applicability and effectiveness in problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify overlooked steps or assumptions in the original strategy, leading to more innovative and efficient solutions. As a next step, I will outline the desired outcome and reverse-engineer the process to map out each step needed to achieve it. Additionally, I will research examples of successful reverse-engineering in similar contexts to inform and refine my approach.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because it allows me to challenge my usual problem-solving pattern, which often starts from the beginning and progresses linearly. By stepping back and considering the problem from the end goal first, I'm intentionally breaking away from habitual thinking patterns to foster creativity and adaptability, potentially leading to more innovative solutions. This approach encourages a shift in perspective that could reveal hidden assumptions and broaden my strategic toolkit."
