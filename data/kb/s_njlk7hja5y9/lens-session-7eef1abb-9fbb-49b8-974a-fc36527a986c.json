  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to generate fresh and potentially innovative ideas by rearranging existing prompts in unexpected ways. This process could lead to discovering new connections or perspectives that weren't initially apparent. The goal is to explore the creative potential of combining familiar elements in novel configurations.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of seeing the shuffling of prompts as a way to find new ideas, we viewed it as an exercise in understanding our own thought patterns and biases? By analyzing the prompts that emerge and the connections they form, we could gain insights into the underlying themes or areas of interest that consistently capture our attention. This reframed approach shifts the focus from idea generation to self-discovery and reflection.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens on this trigger raises the question: How can the process of shuffling prompts be systematically refined to uncover deeper insights about our cognitive processes? Additionally, what methodologies or tools could be developed to track and analyze the patterns and themes that emerge from repeated prompt shuffling? This could lead to further investigation into the psychological and cognitive mechanisms that drive creativity and idea formation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by systematically shuffling and analyzing my own prompts, I can uncover recurring themes and cognitive biases that shape my thinking. As a next step, I will create a tool or method to shuffle prompts and track the emerging patterns over time. This will help me gain deeper insights into my thought processes and potentially identify areas for creative exploration or personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now as a means of both generating new ideas and uncovering patterns in my thinking. This approach repeats a pattern of seeking novelty and introspection, as it involves both the creative exploration of new configurations and a reflective analysis of my cognitive processes. By examining the outcomes, I aim to balance innovation with self-awareness, using this exercise to refine my understanding of my own thought dynamics."
