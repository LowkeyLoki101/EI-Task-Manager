  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that would genuinely surprise me. This involves considering my current beliefs, assumptions, and knowledge gaps to pinpoint what findings would be out of the ordinary or challenge my existing understanding. By framing this, I can better focus on exploring areas where surprises are most likely to occur, paving the way for growth and innovation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on my current beliefs and assumptions, consider what would surprise someone with a vastly different background or expertise. By stepping into the shoes of someone from a different cultural, professional, or experiential perspective, I can identify discoveries that might not only surprise me but also offer broader, more diverse insights. This shift in perspective could unearth surprising elements that are not immediately apparent within my usual frame of reference.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive question of \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to considering what underlying assumptions or biases might be influencing my sense of surprise. It prompts deeper research into the origins of these assumptions and how they shape my perception. Additionally, it raises questions about how new technologies or interdisciplinary approaches might challenge or redefine what is considered surprising, suggesting further investigation into emerging fields or cross-disciplinary innovations.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that to uncover surprising insights, I need to actively engage with diverse perspectives and emerging fields. As a next step, I will seek out interdisciplinary collaborations or discussions with individuals from different backgrounds to challenge my existing assumptions. Additionally, I will explore cutting-edge research in areas outside my usual scope to identify potential surprises that could expand my understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about surprises because they challenge my assumptions and push the boundaries of my understanding, leading to personal and professional growth. I tend to approach problems by focusing on my existing knowledge and perspectives, which might limit my ability to identify truly unexpected insights. This pattern can be shifted by incorporating diverse viewpoints and actively seeking out unfamiliar or counterintuitive information."
