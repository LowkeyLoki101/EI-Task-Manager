  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying what unexpected discoveries might exist that would genuinely surprise me. This involves examining my assumptions and expectations about a particular situation or area of interest to uncover what lies beyond my current understanding or predictions. By clarifying what would be surprising, I can focus on exploring areas where my knowledge or preconceived notions may be limited or challenged.",
  "reframeStep": "From another angle, consider the possibility that the most surprising discoveries aren't hidden in unfamiliar territories but rather within familiar contexts that I've overlooked or taken for granted. Instead of focusing solely on new or unknown areas, I could examine my current environment and routine with fresh eyes, questioning the status quo and identifying surprising elements that have been hiding in plain sight. By doing so, I might uncover unexpected insights or opportunities for growth right within my existing framework.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying assumptions are guiding my current understanding, and how might challenging these assumptions reveal surprises? Are there particular areas within my familiar contexts that I habitually overlook and could benefit from deeper scrutiny? Additionally, what methodologies or tools could I adopt that might help uncover these surprising elements more effectively? Exploring these questions could lead to unexpected findings that shift my perspective or open new avenues for exploration.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries are likely hidden within the assumptions I take for granted in my daily life. As a next step, I will intentionally examine familiar areas of my life with a critical eye, questioning what I typically overlook or assume to be true. I plan to set aside time each week to reflect on one aspect of my routine or environment, aiming to uncover unexpected insights or opportunities for growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By using the meta-lens, I'm examining why I'm drawn to the question of surprise and what it reveals about my habitual thinking patterns. This reflects a tendency to seek out novelty and challenge my existing beliefs, suggesting a pattern of valuing growth and discovery. By recognizing this, I can intentionally balance my focus between seeking surprises and appreciating the known, ensuring a comprehensive approach to learning and exploration."
