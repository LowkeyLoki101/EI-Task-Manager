  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely related to a personal or professional challenge that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to confront. This might involve a difficult decision, an unresolved conflict, or an aspect of my life that requires significant change or effort. By not addressing it, I might be inadvertently allowing the issue to persist or worsen.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't as daunting as it seems? Instead of viewing it as an overwhelming challenge, I could see it as an opportunity for growth or learning. By approaching it with curiosity and openness, I might discover new strengths or solutions that were previously obscured by my avoidance. This shift in perspective could transform the problem from a source of stress to a catalyst for positive change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this problem recursively, I can ask: What specific emotions or beliefs are causing me to avoid this issue? Are there underlying fears or assumptions that need to be unpacked? Additionally, investigating whether there are patterns in how I handle similar problems in the past could provide insights into my avoidance. Delving into these areas could reveal deeper insights or strategies for addressing the problem more effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is rooted in fear or discomfort about a necessary change or confrontation. As a next step, I will dedicate time to reflect on the specific emotions and beliefs that are causing this avoidance, and write down any patterns I notice from past experiences. This will help me develop a concrete plan to address the issue constructively, turning it into an opportunity for growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem right now because it represents a recurring pattern in my life where I tend to avoid uncomfortable situations or decisions. This avoidance often stems from a fear of failure or confrontation, which prevents me from addressing issues directly and proactively. Recognizing this pattern allows me to consciously choose a different approach, breaking the cycle of avoidance by developing strategies to face challenges head-on with confidence."
