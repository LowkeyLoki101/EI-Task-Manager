  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a potentially overlooked question that could lead to personal growth or insight. I see a need to explore areas of life or thought that I haven't recently examined, which might include career goals, personal relationships, or self-care practices. This involves reflecting on areas that haven't been consciously evaluated or questioned in some time.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked myself in a while, I could reframe this to consider what assumptions I'm currently making without questioning. This shift in perspective emphasizes the underlying beliefs guiding my decisions and actions, prompting an exploration of whether these assumptions still hold true. By examining these beliefs, I might discover areas ripe for growth or change that I hadn't previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" leads to several new lines of inquiry. What are the underlying reasons I stopped asking certain questions, and how have my priorities or circumstances changed over time? Additionally, it would be valuable to explore what other questions might emerge from revisiting past inquiries, and whether there are external influences that have shaped which questions I consider important. This exploration could benefit from deeper research into personal reflection techniques or evaluating how external factors, like societal norms or peer influence, impact the questions I prioritize.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by revisiting past questions and assumptions, I can uncover areas of personal or professional life that might benefit from renewed attention. As a next step, I will set aside time for a reflective journaling session to consciously identify and examine these overlooked questions or assumptions. This process will help me clarify which aspects of my life could benefit from change or further exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Reflecting with a meta-lens, I'm thinking about this because it seems to be a recurring pattern in my life to occasionally step back and reassess areas that might be operating on autopilot. This pattern of introspection often arises when I'm at a crossroads or seeking deeper understanding. By examining this inclination, I can gain insight into how it shapes my growth and identify if there's a habitual tendency to overlook continuous self-evaluation."
