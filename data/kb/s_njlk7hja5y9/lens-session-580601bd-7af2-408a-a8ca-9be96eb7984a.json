  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to identify a compelling story hook for creating timely and engaging marketing content. The focus should be on finding a narrative or angle that resonates with the target audience's current interests or needs, effectively capturing their attention and encouraging engagement with the content.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the focus shifted from creating marketing content with a story hook to engaging in a conversation with the audience? Instead of crafting a narrative, consider leveraging user-generated content or inviting audience interaction to shape the story. This approach could foster a more authentic connection and ensure the content remains relevant and resonant with the audience's real-time interests and feedback.",

  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What current events or trends are influencing the target audience's interests today? How can emerging technologies or platforms be utilized to enhance storytelling and engagement? It might also be valuable to investigate how competitors are currently engaging their audiences and what successful strategies they are employing. These areas deserve deeper research to uncover timely and effective story hooks that resonate with the audience's evolving preferences and behaviors.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content because it directly impacts the effectiveness of audience engagement and brand communication. This reflects a pattern of focusing on narrative creation as a primary tool for marketing, which may overlook the potential of interactive or user-driven content strategies. By examining this pattern, I can explore alternative content approaches that might better align with evolving audience preferences and behaviors."
