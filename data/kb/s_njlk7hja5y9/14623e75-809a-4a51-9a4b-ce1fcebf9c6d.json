  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that engaging with experts and stakeholders will help co-create a simulation that addresses current data gaps and meets our objectives. The next step is to organize a workshop or meeting with these collaborators to define the simulation's parameters and objectives, ensuring they are flexible enough to adapt to new insights. This collaborative approach will enhance the reliability and relevance of the simulated data for our decision-making processes.",
