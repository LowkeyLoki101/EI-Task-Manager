  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an important or overlooked question that I haven't considered recently, which could lead to new insights or perspectives. This involves reflecting on areas of my life, work, or personal growth that may have been neglected or assumed stagnant. By pinpointing such a question, I can uncover opportunities for self-improvement or novel understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the original question from a different angle, consider this: What if the question I haven't asked myself in a while isn't about introspection, but about my interactions with others? Shifting the focus from internal self-assessment to external relationships might uncover areas where I can grow, improve communication, or strengthen connections. Alternatively, what if the overlooked question pertains to a completely new area of interest or knowledge, prompting me to explore unfamiliar territories and broaden my horizons?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, the exploration might lead to pondering: \"What assumptions have I made about my relationships that need revisiting?\" or \"What areas of knowledge have I avoided exploring due to perceived complexity?\" These questions deserve deeper investigation as they can reveal biases or gaps in understanding, prompting growth in personal and professional spheres. It would be beneficial to actively seek feedback or delve into unfamiliar subjects to address these newly surfaced inquiries.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the question I haven't asked myself in a while likely involves assumptions about my relationships or unexplored areas of knowledge. The next step is to actively seek feedback from friends or colleagues about my interactions with them, and to intentionally explore a new subject that I've been hesitant to approach. This will help uncover overlooked areas for growth and enhance both personal and professional development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it indicates a pattern of seeking growth and self-awareness, often revisited when I feel the need for change or deeper understanding. This could be part of a broader pattern where I periodically assess my life to ensure alignment with my values and goals. By examining this pattern, I might recognize an opportunity to regularly schedule reflective practices, rather than waiting for the sporadic urge to ask such questions."
