  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is the pursuit of unexpected or surprising discoveries. The focus is on identifying what specific findings or outcomes would be genuinely surprising to you within a particular context or field. Clearly defining these potential surprises will help guide exploration and encourage openness to novel insights.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on what would surprise you, consider what assumptions or biases you currently hold that might be challenged by new discoveries. Reframe the question to: \"What assumptions am I making that, if proven wrong, would lead to surprising insights?\" By approaching it from this angle, the emphasis shifts to uncovering and questioning existing beliefs, potentially leading to more profound and unexpected revelations.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the original trigger, \"What would surprise me if I found it?\", prompts further exploration into the nature of surprise itself. This could lead to questions like: What are the factors that contribute to something being surprising? How do cultural, historical, or personal contexts influence what we find surprising? Additionally, it might be worth investigating how the element of surprise can be leveraged to drive innovation or creativity in a given field. These questions can guide deeper research into the dynamics of surprise and its role in discovery and learning.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often stem from challenging existing assumptions. As a next step, I will list my current assumptions in a specific field and actively seek out information or perspectives that could contradict them. This approach will help me remain open to surprising insights and foster a mindset conducive to innovation and deeper understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I have a natural curiosity to uncover the unknown and challenge my current understanding. The pattern I'm repeating is a focus on questioning and expanding my existing knowledge base by seeking out surprises and unexpected insights. This approach often leads me to reevaluate my assumptions, encouraging continuous learning and adaptation."
