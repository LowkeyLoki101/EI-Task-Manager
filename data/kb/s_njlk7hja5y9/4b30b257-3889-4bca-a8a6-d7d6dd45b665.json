  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will uncover hidden assumptions and offer new insights into more efficient pathways to the desired outcome. As a next step, I'll identify the final outcome I aim to achieve and list the steps required to reach it in reverse order. This process will help in identifying any overlooked opportunities or constraints that could redefine the original problem.",
