  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by reverse-engineering the problem, I can identify key actions and decision points that are critical to achieving the desired outcome. As a next step, I will map out the end result and work backwards to the starting point, identifying dependencies and potential feedback loops. This approach will help reveal any overlooked elements and guide me in adjusting my strategy to ensure a successful outcome.",
