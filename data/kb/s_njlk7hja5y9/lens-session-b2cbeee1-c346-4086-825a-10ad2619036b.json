  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves considering the outcomes or solutions of a situation by starting from the end result and working backwards to the starting point. By framing it this way, the focus is on reverse engineering the process to identify what steps, decisions, or actions would lead to the desired outcome. This approach may reveal overlooked dependencies or assumptions and help in understanding the critical path to success.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger from an entirely different perspective, consider what insights might emerge if, instead of focusing on the end result, you begin from the most foundational elements of the problem and build forward. This angle emphasizes understanding the underlying principles and foundational components that give rise to the situation, potentially uncovering root causes or fundamental building blocks that could lead to innovative solutions when combined or adjusted. By focusing on the origins, you might also identify alternative pathways that haven't been considered, offering new directions or strategies.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What smaller, iterative steps could be reverse-engineered from the desired outcome to the starting point? Are there any feedback loops or cyclical processes within the problem that could be leveraged when approaching it backwards? Further investigation could delve into identifying key decision points or variables that have the greatest impact on the outcome and exploring how these can be influenced or adjusted throughout the reverse-engineering process. Additionally, researching historical examples where reverse-engineering led to innovative solutions might provide insights applicable to the current problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by reverse-engineering the problem, I can identify key actions and decision points that are critical to achieving the desired outcome. As a next step, I will map out the end result and work backwards to the starting point, identifying dependencies and potential feedback loops. This approach will help reveal any overlooked elements and guide me in adjusting my strategy to ensure a successful outcome.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about approaching the problem backwards, I'm likely engaging in a pattern of critical analysis where I seek to deconstruct complex issues to better understand them. This approach often helps me identify missing pieces or incorrect assumptions by challenging the typical linear progression of problem-solving. Recognizing this pattern can encourage me to intentionally integrate both forward and backward thinking in my problem-solving toolkit, ensuring a more comprehensive exploration of potential solutions."
