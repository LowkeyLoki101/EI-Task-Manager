  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I consistently notice a pattern where complex problems are often approached with overly complicated solutions, while simpler, more efficient solutions are overlooked. This tendency to complicate rather than simplify might be missed by others who are caught up in the intricacies of the issue rather than stepping back to see the broader, simpler picture. This pattern could lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for more effective problem-solving.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the pattern of over-complicating solutions might not be a flaw but rather a reflection of the diverse ways individuals approach problem-solving. What if this complexity is essential for fostering innovation and ensuring thoroughness? By recognizing the value in both complex and simple approaches, you might uncover a balance that leverages the strengths of varied perspectives, leading to more holistic and adaptable solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this pattern further, questions arise about why individuals lean towards complexity: Is it due to educational training, cultural influences, or specific industry norms that prioritize thoroughness over simplicity? Additionally, what methodologies or frameworks could be researched or developed to systematically identify when complexity is beneficial versus when simplicity is more effective? Investigating these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of decision-making processes and the development of tools to guide more balanced problem-solving approaches.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the inclination towards complexity in problem-solving may stem from educational and cultural norms that value thoroughness. To address this, I will research methodologies that help identify when simplicity should be prioritized over complexity and develop a framework for balanced decision-making. My next step is to gather insights from various fields where simplicity has led to successful outcomes, aiming to create a resource that guides individuals in choosing the most effective approach for different scenarios.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm considering why I focus on identifying overlooked patterns, which may stem from a tendency to seek clarity and efficiency in problem-solving. This reflective approach might be a recurring pattern in my thinking process, where I prioritize simplifying complexity, potentially missing the nuances that complexity can provide. Recognizing this allows me to balance my focus, ensuring I appreciate both straightforward and intricate solutions for more comprehensive understanding and innovation."
