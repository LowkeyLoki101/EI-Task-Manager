  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying an important question that has been overlooked or ignored in recent times. This involves introspection to uncover areas of personal growth, decision-making, or reflection that have not been considered lately. The goal is to pinpoint a question that, when addressed, could lead to valuable insights or improvements in one's life.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on uncovering a specific question you haven't asked yourself, consider reframing the approach to explore broader themes or areas of your life that have been neglected. Ask yourself, \"What are the parts of my life that I haven't examined recently?\" or \"Which aspects of my routine have become so familiar that I no longer question them?\" This shift in perspective encourages a more holistic review of your life, potentially revealing overlooked areas that could benefit from introspection and new questions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying beliefs or assumptions that might be preventing me from asking certain questions about my life? How do the patterns and habits in my daily routine contribute to the neglect of important introspective queries? Investigating these areas could uncover deeper insights into why certain questions remain unasked, prompting a more thoughtful examination of personal growth and decision-making processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are underlying assumptions or comfort zones in my life that prevent me from questioning certain areas. As a next step, I will allocate time this week to journal about different aspects of my life, such as career, relationships, and personal growth, focusing on identifying any areas that feel stagnant or unquestioned. This process will help uncover specific questions that have been neglected and may lead to valuable insights for personal development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm considering why the original trigger—seeking an overlooked question—is important to me now. This pattern suggests a desire for self-awareness and growth, indicating that I might be seeking to break free from routine or complacency. Recognizing this pattern can guide me to consciously challenge my assumptions and explore areas that are ripe for personal development or change."
