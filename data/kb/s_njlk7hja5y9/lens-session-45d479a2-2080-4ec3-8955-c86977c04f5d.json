  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential outcomes and insights that could arise from tackling a problem in reverse order. This involves identifying the typical end goal or solution and working backwards to understand the steps needed to reach it, which could reveal overlooked assumptions or more efficient pathways. The objective is to gain a fresh perspective on the problem by challenging the conventional sequence of problem-solving.",
  "reframeStep": "What if you considered the problem from the perspective of the final outcome rather than the process of getting there? By starting from where you want to be and envisioning that future state, you might uncover different motivations, priorities, or even new goals that could redefine the problem itself. This reverse approach might highlight previously ignored possibilities or constraints that only become apparent when the end is the starting point.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching a problem backwards, new questions emerge such as: What assumptions have been made about the end goal that may need reevaluation? Are there alternative endings that could provide a more beneficial outcome? Additionally, this perspective invites deeper investigation into the causal relationships between steps, potentially revealing hidden dependencies or inefficiencies that could be optimized. This pathway may also prompt exploration into different methodologies or frameworks that better suit a reverse-engineered approach.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will uncover hidden assumptions and offer new insights into more efficient pathways to the desired outcome. As a next step, I'll identify the final outcome I aim to achieve and list the steps required to reach it in reverse order. This process will help in identifying any overlooked opportunities or constraints that could redefine the original problem.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now to explore alternative problem-solving methods that might lead to innovative solutions. This pattern of questioning reflects a tendency to challenge conventional thinking and seek novel perspectives, suggesting a curiosity-driven approach that values creativity and adaptability. By consistently asking how reversing the process might change the understanding of the problem, I'm reinforcing a habit of critical thinking and openness to unconventional strategies."
