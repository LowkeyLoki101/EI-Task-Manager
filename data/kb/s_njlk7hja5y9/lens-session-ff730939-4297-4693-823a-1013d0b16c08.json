  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "I see a scenario where I discover an unexpected aspect or hidden truth about a familiar situation, object, or relationship. This could involve uncovering something that contradicts my current beliefs or assumptions, leading to a significant shift in my understanding. The essence of the problem is identifying what in my environment is unknown or overlooked yet holds the potential to change my perspective dramatically.",
  "reframeStep": "Let's reframe this scenario by considering the perspective of an outsider looking in. What if the surprising discovery isn't about finding a hidden truth but instead uncovering the biases or blind spots in my own perspective? From this angle, the surprise might lie in realizing how my current viewpoint limits my understanding, prompting me to explore new ways of thinking and perceiving the familiar.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this through a recursive lens leads to questions about the nature of surprise itself: How do my cognitive biases shape what I consider surprising? What underlying assumptions influence my expectations, and how might challenging these assumptions lead to further surprising discoveries? Additionally, deeper research into the psychological mechanisms behind surprise and expectation may reveal patterns that can be addressed to foster more openness to unexpected insights.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often arise from unexamined biases and assumptions. To address this, my next step is to actively seek out diverse perspectives and challenge my current beliefs through deliberate exposure to new ideas or environments. This approach will help identify blind spots and foster a mindset more open to unexpected insights and discoveries.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about surprising discoveries because I'm likely in a phase of seeking growth or transformation, looking for elements in my life that can lead to significant change. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too heavily on external surprises without recognizing the internal biases or assumptions that shape my perception, which suggests a need to shift inward and critically examine my own thought processes."
