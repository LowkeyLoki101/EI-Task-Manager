  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is about generating new and potentially innovative prompts by mixing and reorganizing existing ones. This involves exploring the creative potential that arises from breaking away from traditional patterns and combinations, leading to fresh perspectives and insights. The aim is to see what novel and valuable ideas can emerge from this rearrangement.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the act of shuffling your prompts as akin to remixing a piece of music. In this light, each prompt is a musical note or chord, and by rearranging them, you're creating a new composition that might evoke different emotions or insights than the original. This reframing suggests focusing on the harmony and dissonance between ideas, exploring how they can be orchestrated to produce a symphony of innovation and creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying a recursive lens to the idea of shuffling prompts raises questions about the underlying structure and components of these prompts. What are the fundamental elements or themes within the prompts that might influence the outcomes of their rearrangement? Additionally, how might iterative shuffling processes—repeatedly remixing and analyzing the results—lead to the emergence of new patterns or unexpected ideas that could be explored further for innovative insights? This suggests an investigation into algorithmic or systematic approaches to shuffling that could maximize creativity and originality.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to unexpected and innovative combinations that may inspire new insights or creative directions. As a next step, I'll implement a systematic approach to shuffle and remix my prompts, possibly using a simple algorithm or randomization tool, and then analyze the new combinations for potential patterns or themes that could be further explored. This approach will help identify unique prompts that stand out and warrant deeper investigation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts because I'm seeking new insights and creative breakthroughs by disrupting my usual thought patterns. This approach reflects a recurring pattern of exploring innovation through recombination, similar to how I might experiment with different frameworks or methodologies to gain fresh perspectives. By consciously recognizing this pattern, I can intentionally harness it to enhance my problem-solving and creative processes."
