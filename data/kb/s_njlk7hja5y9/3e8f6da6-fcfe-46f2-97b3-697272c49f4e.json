  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify key steps and potential obstacles that are not immediately apparent in a forward approach. The next step will be to outline the desired outcome and then map out the steps leading back to the present situation, paying close attention to any dependencies or assumptions that emerge. This backward mapping will help highlight alternative pathways or innovative solutions, which can then be evaluated for feasibility and effectiveness.",
