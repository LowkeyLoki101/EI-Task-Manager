  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring creativity and innovation by rearranging existing prompts to generate fresh and potentially unexpected insights or ideas. The focus is on the potential outcomes of altering the sequence or combination of known elements to discover new perspectives or questions. This process involves dissecting and recombining prompts to see what novel solutions or concepts can be unveiled.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on the novelty of the prompts themselves, we reframed the exercise as an exploration of how reshuffling prompts can reveal biases or limitations in our current thinking? By examining the patterns and themes that emerge from the new combinations, we might uncover underlying assumptions or neglected areas of inquiry. This shift in perspective could lead to more strategic questioning and a broader understanding of the topics at hand.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling your own prompts, you might question how this process could be applied to other areas, such as problem-solving techniques or learning strategies. This leads to deeper investigation into whether reshuffling can systematically uncover hidden connections or insights across different domains. Additionally, exploring how different disciplines might benefit from similar reshuffling could reveal interdisciplinary innovation opportunities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that reshuffling prompts can uncover hidden biases and foster new insights across various domains. The next step is to systematically shuffle a set of existing prompts and document the themes or patterns that emerge. I'll then analyze these results to identify any overlooked areas or assumptions in my thinking and explore how similar approaches could benefit problem-solving or learning strategies in other fields.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts right now to explore creativity and innovation, but stepping back with a meta-lens reveals a deeper drive to break free from habitual thinking patterns. This approach reflects a recurring pattern in my methodology: a curiosity-driven quest to uncover hidden insights by altering familiar structures. By recognizing this pattern, I can consciously harness it to challenge my assumptions and expand my cognitive horizons more strategically."
