  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is the exploration of unexpected discoveries or insights that could challenge current assumptions or beliefs. What would surprise me is finding evidence or information that significantly contradicts what I currently understand or assume to be true, prompting a reassessment of my knowledge or perspective. The challenge is identifying those areas where my assumptions are vulnerable to such surprises.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on surprises that contradict current beliefs, consider reframing the exploration towards uncovering unknown potentials or opportunities that you haven't yet imagined. What if the surprise isn't a contradiction, but a discovery of a new path or capability that enhances or expands your current understanding? This perspective shifts the focus from challenging assumptions to identifying new possibilities that could lead to growth or innovation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to new questions such as: What areas of my life or work have I not fully explored that could hold unexpected discoveries? Are there fields or disciplines outside my current expertise that could provide surprising insights or innovations? These questions suggest the need for deeper research into interdisciplinary approaches and untapped areas of knowledge that may reveal unforeseen opportunities or solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas that are underexplored or outside my usual scope of inquiry. As a next step, I will actively seek out and engage with interdisciplinary fields or new domains of knowledge that I haven't yet considered, in order to uncover potential surprises that could lead to growth or innovation. This could involve attending lectures, reading literature from unfamiliar disciplines, or networking with experts in different fields.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about surprises and unexpected discoveries because I am driven by a desire to grow and expand my understanding, often seeking to challenge my current beliefs. A recurring pattern in my approach is focusing primarily on contradictions to existing assumptions rather than actively searching for new opportunities or paths that could lead to innovation. By recognizing this, I can intentionally shift my mindset to explore uncharted territories that may not necessarily contradict my beliefs, but rather complement and enhance them."
