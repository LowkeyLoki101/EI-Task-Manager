  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the recurring oversight in addressing root causes presents an opportunity to innovate proactive systems that prevent issues before they arise. My next step is to research industries with successful proactive problem-solving frameworks and explore how these can be adapted or improved for broader application. This will involve identifying key elements of these systems and considering how they can be integrated into different contexts to foster a culture of foresight and continuous improvement.",
