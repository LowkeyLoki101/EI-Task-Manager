  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying a potentially overlooked aspect of self-reflection or personal growth that hasn't been considered recently. The focus is to uncover a question that could reveal new insights or areas for development. By revisiting unasked questions, you can gain a fresh perspective on your current life situation or goals.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached this from the perspective of someone else's point of view? Instead of focusing solely on questions you haven't asked yourself, consider what questions those closest to you might ask about your life or decisions. By seeking out perspectives from friends, family, or mentors, you might uncover areas for reflection that you've completely overlooked or dismissed, providing a fresh pathway for growth and self-awareness.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, one might explore how regularly revisiting overlooked questions can contribute to ongoing personal development. This could lead to further questions like: \"What systems can I implement to ensure I regularly revisit and re-evaluate these questions?\" or \"How can I track the evolution of my responses over time to identify patterns or changes?\" Investigating these areas might provide deeper insights into maintaining a dynamic and reflective personal growth process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by actively seeking questions from others and implementing a system to regularly revisit unasked questions, I can uncover new areas for personal growth. The next step is to reach out to a trusted friend or mentor to gain their perspective on what questions I might be overlooking. Additionally, I'll set a reminder to periodically review and evaluate these questions, tracking how my responses evolve over time.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about the question you haven't asked yourself in a while, you're engaging in a pattern of introspection and self-evaluation, which is crucial for personal growth. This pattern reflects a continual pursuit of self-awareness and improvement. By acknowledging this meta-pattern, you can refine your approach by not only seeking new questions but also evaluating the effectiveness and depth of your current self-reflective practices."
