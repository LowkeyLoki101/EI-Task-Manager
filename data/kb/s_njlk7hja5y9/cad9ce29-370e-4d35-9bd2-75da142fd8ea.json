  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to first conduct a thorough review of existing simulation models and datasets that align with our objectives, to determine if they can be effectively adapted for our needs. The next step is to identify specific parameters and variables that are crucial for our focus area, and then evaluate potential partnerships with experts or teams who have experience in those simulations. This approach will guide us in either adapting an existing model or designing a new simulation framework that efficiently generates the data we need.",
