  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption being made is that AI will have a positive and transformative impact on the energy sector, leading to increased efficiency and sustainability. If I consider the reverse—that AI might introduce complexities, require significant resource investment, or even create unforeseen challenges—the outcome could shift towards a more cautious and evaluative approach in integrating AI technologies, potentially slowing down adoption but ensuring more thorough risk management.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on whether AI will have a positive or negative impact, we shifted our perspective to consider AI as a neutral tool whose outcome heavily depends on human decisions and implementation strategies in the energy sector? By reframing the assumption to view AI as neither inherently beneficial nor detrimental, it emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, ethical considerations, and ongoing evaluation to harness AI's potential effectively and responsibly in the energy industry. This approach could lead to more balanced decision-making, prioritizing adaptability and resilience in AI integration.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens to the original trigger, new questions emerge about the broader systemic impacts of AI in the energy sector: How might AI-driven changes in the energy sector influence global energy policies and economic structures? What new ethical considerations arise as AI potentially shifts power dynamics within energy resource management? These questions deserve deeper research to understand the long-term implications of AI integration on global sustainability and equity in energy access.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the impact of AI in the energy sector is not predetermined as positive or negative but is contingent upon human choices and strategic implementation. The next action is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing AI applications in the energy sector, focusing on case studies that highlight both successful integrations and challenges faced. This will provide insights into best practices and potential pitfalls, guiding a more informed approach to AI adoption in energy.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm examining why I'm focusing on AI's impact in the energy sector now. This introspection might stem from a broader pattern of scrutinizing technological advancements for their immediate benefits, while potentially overlooking longer-term implications and dependencies. Recognizing this pattern encourages a more comprehensive approach, ensuring that I consider both immediate advantages and the broader context of AI's integration, including ethical, social, and environmental factors."
