  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying or designing a simulation that generates new, relevant data for analysis or decision-making. Specifically, the goal is to determine what type of simulation would effectively produce this data, considering the context and objectives of the data collection. It involves understanding the current gaps in data and how a simulation can help fill those gaps with useful information.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what simulation to run, consider what specific questions you want the new data to answer or what problems you need to solve. From this perspective, assess whether a simulation is the best tool for the job, or if other methods such as experiments, surveys, or data integration from existing sources might be more effective. This shift in focus from the tool to the desired outcome may reveal alternative approaches to generating the data you need.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive perspective, consider what assumptions or variables are critical to the simulation's outcomes. What are the potential limitations or biases of the simulation method you might choose, and how could these impact the validity of the generated data? Additionally, what new questions about the simulation's design, such as the complexity of models or the scalability of results, arise that could benefit from deeper research or adjustment?",
  "closureStep": "Based on the reframed focus on desired outcomes and the recursive analysis of potential limitations, my next step is to clearly define the specific questions or problems that the new data needs to address. Once these are established, I will evaluate whether a simulation is the most appropriate approach or if alternative methods might be more effective. If a simulation is deemed suitable, I will then identify key assumptions and variables to develop a model that accurately reflects the conditions necessary to generate relevant data.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about simulations to generate new data because there's a drive to fill existing knowledge gaps and enhance decision-making capabilities. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on the tool (simulation) rather than the underlying need or question that the data is intended to address. By stepping back, I can reassess whether simulations are the right approach or if other data-gathering methods might better serve the ultimate purpose."
