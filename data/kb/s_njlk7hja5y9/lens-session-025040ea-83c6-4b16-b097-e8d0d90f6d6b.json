  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about a significant issue or challenge that is causing me stress or discomfort, perhaps because it feels overwhelming or because I fear the implications of addressing it. This avoidance might relate to work, relationships, health, or personal growth, where confronting the problem could lead to necessary but difficult changes. Identifying and articulating this problem is the first step towards finding a solution and relieving the underlying anxiety.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the problem I'm avoiding might not be as intimidating as it seems, and that my avoidance could be stemming from a fear of success rather than failure. What if addressing this issue could lead to unexpected opportunities or personal growth that I have yet to imagine? By reframing the situation as a chance for positive transformation rather than a daunting obstacle, I might find the motivation and courage to face it head-on.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific factors are contributing to my avoidance of this problem, and how can I address those underlying issues? Are there past experiences or fears that are influencing my perspective on this challenge? Additionally, how might breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks help reduce the feeling of overwhelm and facilitate a clearer path forward? Identifying these elements could provide insights into more effective strategies for tackling the problem.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is rooted in a fear of the unknown and potential change it could bring. To move forward, I will identify and write down the specific aspects of this problem that feel overwhelming, and break them into smaller, actionable steps. This week, I'll tackle the first step, such as seeking advice from a trusted colleague or friend, to begin addressing the issue and reduce my avoidance.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because I recognize a recurring pattern of avoidance in facing significant challenges, which often leads to increased anxiety and missed opportunities for growth. By using the meta-lens, I can see that this tendency to avoid difficult issues is a habitual response to discomfort, driven by a fear of failure or change. Acknowledging this pattern allows me to consciously choose a different approach, one that embraces challenges as opportunities for learning and development."
