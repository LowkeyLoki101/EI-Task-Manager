  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying unexpected discoveries that would genuinely surprise me, suggesting a gap between my current understanding and potential realities. This involves questioning assumptions and exploring areas I may have overlooked or underestimated. The aim is to uncover insights or phenomena that challenge my existing knowledge or beliefs.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what would surprise me, consider reframing the question to explore what assumptions I currently hold that, if proven wrong, would lead to a surprising discovery. This shifts the perspective from seeking surprises to challenging and testing my existing beliefs, which could reveal unexpected insights. By actively questioning my foundational assumptions, I may uncover areas ripe for exploration and potential revelation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying assumptions in my current knowledge that could be dramatically transformed by new information? How might these assumptions shape my perception of reality, and what specific domains or fields should I explore to potentially encounter these surprises? Additionally, what methodologies or tools can I employ to systematically challenge and test these assumptions to uncover unexpected insights?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by systematically challenging my foundational assumptions, I can uncover surprising insights that currently lie outside my awareness. The next step is to identify specific domains or fields where these assumptions are most prevalent and employ methodologies, such as critical questioning or scenario analysis, to test and potentially overturn them. This approach will guide me toward unexpected discoveries and broaden my understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now to challenge my current understanding and expand my knowledge by identifying blind spots or assumptions that I haven't questioned. This pattern of introspection and curiosity reflects a continuous pursuit of learning and growth. By repeatedly questioning my beliefs, I open the door to new insights and innovation, ensuring that I don't become complacent in my existing knowledge."
