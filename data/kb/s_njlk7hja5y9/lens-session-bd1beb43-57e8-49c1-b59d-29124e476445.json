  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring new possibilities by rearranging existing elementsâ€”in this case, prompts. By shuffling your own prompts, you could discover fresh perspectives or insights that were not initially apparent. This approach encourages creativity and innovation by breaking away from habitual thought patterns.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on shuffling your existing prompts, you approached this from the perspective of generating completely new prompts that challenge your current assumptions? By creating prompts that deliberately push the boundaries of your comfort zone, you might uncover even more unexpected and transformative insights. This reframing shifts the focus from rearranging what you already have to constructing entirely novel questions that provoke deeper exploration.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential cognitive benefits of regularly shuffling prompts or constructing new ones in creative problem-solving? How might this practice influence one's ability to innovate or adapt in various fields? Investigating these questions could lead to deeper insights into the role of dynamic thinking strategies in personal and professional development. Additionally, exploring the neurological basis of how shuffling prompts impacts brain activity could offer valuable research avenues.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that regularly shuffling prompts or creating new ones can significantly enhance creative problem-solving by fostering dynamic thinking. The next step is to implement a routine where I either shuffle existing prompts or generate new, challenging ones weekly. This practice will help uncover fresh insights and potentially lead to innovative ideas across various fields.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about shuffling your prompts, you're engaging in a pattern of seeking novelty through rearrangement rather than creation. This approach often reflects a comfort with familiar elements while still desiring new outcomes. By recognizing this pattern, you can consciously choose to either continue exploring within known boundaries or challenge yourself to step outside them by generating entirely new prompts that might lead to more profound insights."
