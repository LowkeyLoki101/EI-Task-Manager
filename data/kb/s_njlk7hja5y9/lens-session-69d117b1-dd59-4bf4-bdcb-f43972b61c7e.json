  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to re-evaluate the problem-solving process by starting with the desired outcome and working in reverse. This approach could reveal overlooked steps or assumptions that are critical to achieving the goal. By identifying the endpoint first, I can map out the necessary actions backwards, potentially simplifying the path to a solution.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the approach from another angle, consider tackling the problem by focusing on potential obstacles first rather than starting with the outcome. By identifying and addressing possible barriers or challenges at the outset, the path to the solution may become clearer and smoother. This proactive strategy could lead to a more efficient problem-solving process by preemptively resolving issues that might arise along the way.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the concept of approaching a problem backwards, we could delve into how this method might influence different types of problem-solving, such as creative design or technical troubleshooting. Questions like \"What are the psychological effects of reverse problem-solving?\" or \"How can reverse engineering principles be applied across various fields?\" could emerge as areas for deeper research. Investigating these questions could provide insights into optimizing problem-solving strategies across diverse disciplines.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can help streamline the problem-solving process by highlighting critical steps and potential obstacles early on. The next step is to apply this reverse approach to a specific problem I'm currently facing, documenting each step taken and the insights gained. This will allow me to evaluate its effectiveness and adjust my problem-solving methods accordingly in future situations.",
