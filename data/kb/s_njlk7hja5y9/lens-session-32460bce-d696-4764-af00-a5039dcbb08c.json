  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring the potential to generate fresh and innovative prompts by rearranging existing ones. By shuffling these prompts, the goal is to uncover new questions or perspectives that might lead to unexpected insights or creative breakthroughs. The task is to identify the value and implications of such a method in enhancing creativity or problem-solving.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on shuffling prompts to generate new ones, we viewed each prompt as a puzzle piece that can interlock with others to form a more comprehensive picture? By considering how different prompts relate and connect, rather than just their individual novelty, we might discover overarching themes or patterns that lead to deeper insights. This approach emphasizes the relationships and context among ideas, potentially leading to more cohesive and meaningful outcomes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to determine the effectiveness or relevance of new prompts generated through shuffling? How can technology, such as AI or machine learning, be leveraged to automate the process and identify patterns or themes among shuffled prompts? Exploring these questions could lead to more sophisticated tools for creative ideation or problem-solving frameworks that utilize prompt shuffling and interconnections.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling prompts and examining how they interconnect, I can uncover new themes and insights that enhance creativity and problem-solving. The next step is to create a small experiment where I shuffle a set of prompts, analyze the new combinations for emerging patterns, and document any novel insights or ideas. Additionally, I will explore using AI tools to automate the shuffling process and analyze results for more systematic exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my own prompts right now because I'm seeking new perspectives and want to break free from repetitive thinking patterns that may limit my creativity. This approach reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and stimulation by rearranging familiar elements to uncover unexpected connections. By recognizing this pattern, I can focus on fostering a mindset that values curiosity and adaptability, allowing me to explore ideas from different angles and develop more innovative solutions."
