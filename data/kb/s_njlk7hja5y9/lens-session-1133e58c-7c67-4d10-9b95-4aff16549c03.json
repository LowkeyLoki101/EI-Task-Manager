  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain trends or behaviors are consistently overlooked by others, potentially due to cognitive biases or lack of perspective. The problem is clearly identifying and articulating these patterns in a way that makes them evident to others, thereby bridging the gap in understanding or awareness. The key is to focus on specific examples or instances where this pattern has manifested, highlighting its implications.",
  "reframeStep": "From another angle, consider that the patterns you notice might not be missed by others due to a lack of awareness, but rather because they prioritize other patterns based on their goals and values. This reframing suggests that the issue may not be about making these patterns more evident, but about understanding and aligning with the perspectives and priorities of others to make these patterns relevant and actionable for them. By exploring the underlying motivations and objectives of others, you can better communicate the importance of the patterns you see in a way that resonates with their interests.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific cognitive biases or situational factors might be causing others to overlook the patterns I see? Are there particular domains or fields where these patterns are more prevalent, and what are the historical or cultural reasons for this oversight? Additionally, how can I develop tools or frameworks to help others better recognize and prioritize these patterns in their decision-making processes?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that others might be missing certain patterns due to cognitive biases or differing priorities. As a next step, I will develop a framework or tool that highlights these patterns and demonstrates their relevance to various stakeholders, aligning them with their goals and values. This approach aims to foster a shared understanding and encourage more inclusive decision-making processes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because there is an inherent desire to bridge the gap between what I perceive and what others prioritize, which can lead to more effective communication and collaboration. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too heavily on my perspective without fully considering how others' values and goals shape their perception. This realization suggests a need to integrate empathy and understanding of different viewpoints into my approach to make these patterns more relevant and meaningful to others."
