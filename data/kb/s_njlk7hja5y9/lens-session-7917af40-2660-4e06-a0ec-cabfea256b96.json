  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential for generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling these prompts, the goal is to discover novel combinations or angles that may not have been evident before, thus fostering innovation and fresh perspectives. This exercise could lead to unexpected and valuable questions or topics to explore further.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of shuffling prompts randomly, you categorized them by themes or patterns first, then explored intersections between different categories? This approach might reveal deeper connections or gaps in your thinking, allowing for more strategic exploration of new ideas. Alternatively, consider involving others in the shuffling process to introduce fresh perspectives and interpretations that you might not see on your own.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, consider exploring how different methods of shuffling—such as algorithmic randomization versus intentional thematic grouping—impact the emergence of new ideas. What tools or frameworks could assist in analyzing the effectiveness of each method? Additionally, investigate how the context in which prompts are shuffled (e.g., personal reflection versus collaborative brainstorming) influences the creativity and relevance of the outcomes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that categorizing prompts by themes and then exploring their intersections will lead to more strategic and insightful new questions. As a next step, I will organize my prompts into thematic groups and experiment with creating combinations across different categories. Additionally, I will seek feedback from others to introduce diverse perspectives, ensuring a broader range of ideas and interpretations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm exploring this idea to spark creativity and uncover hidden insights within my existing prompts, potentially revealing blind spots or new directions. This reflects a broader pattern of seeking innovation through iterative experimentation and self-reflection, aiming to break out of habitual thinking and engage with fresh perspectives. By doing so, I hope to challenge my cognitive processes and enhance my capacity for creative problem-solving."
