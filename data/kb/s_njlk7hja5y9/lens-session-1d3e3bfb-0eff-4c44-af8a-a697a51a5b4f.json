  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a compelling story hook that resonates with the target audience and effectively promotes the product or service. The goal is to craft a narrative that captures attention, engages emotionally, and aligns with the brand message. It's essential to focus on understanding the audience's needs, desires, and pain points to create a relatable and persuasive marketing piece.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the needs and desires of the target audience, consider reframing the story hook by emphasizing the unique journey or evolution of the brand or product itself. Highlight the challenges overcome, the innovative breakthroughs, and the passionate people behind the scenes. This angle can create a deeper connection by showcasing authenticity and illustrating why the brand stands out in the market.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, several new questions emerge: How can storytelling effectively highlight the unique evolution of a brand? What specific examples of brand journeys have successfully engaged audiences? Additionally, it would be worthwhile to investigate how different storytelling techniques, such as user-generated content or behind-the-scenes insights, impact audience perception and engagement. Researching case studies of successful brand storytelling could provide deeper insights into effective strategies.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a compelling story hook can be crafted by focusing on the unique journey and evolution of the brand or product, emphasizing authenticity and the challenges overcome. As a next step, I will research case studies of successful brand storytelling to identify effective techniques and examples. This will inform the creation of a marketing content strategy that resonates with the audience through a narrative that highlights innovation and passion behind the brand.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm seeking a fresh and engaging way to connect with the audience through marketing content. This reflects a recurring pattern of wanting to innovate and differentiate the brand in a crowded market. By applying a meta-lens, I am questioning whether my approach is too inward-focused, and considering if I should also incorporate broader industry trends or societal themes to enhance relevance and resonance."
