  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can indeed lead to unexpected and creative combinations, but intentionally curating them based on themes or goals might be more effective for targeted insights. As a next step, I will experiment with both methods: shuffling prompts randomly and curating them intentionally around a specific theme. I will then compare the outcomes to determine which approach yields more valuable or actionable ideas.",
