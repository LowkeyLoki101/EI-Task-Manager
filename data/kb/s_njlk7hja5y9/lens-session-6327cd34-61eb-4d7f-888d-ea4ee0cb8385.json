  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is the exploration of unexpected discoveries or insights that could challenge current beliefs or assumptions. Essentially, it involves identifying what would genuinely surprise or astonish you if you encountered it, suggesting a need for open-mindedness and a readiness to embrace the unexpected in various situations. This could apply to personal growth, scientific research, or any field where assumptions are often challenged by new information.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider what might surprise others if they found it, not just you. This shift in focus encourages you to step outside of your personal biases and assumptions, broadening your view to include diverse perspectives. By contemplating what would be unexpected for a wider audience, you can identify insights or discoveries that have the potential to create a larger impact or foster collective growth and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Using the recursive lens on the trigger \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to deeper questions such as: What underlying assumptions do I hold that make certain discoveries surprising? How can I systematically challenge these assumptions to uncover more unexpected insights? Additionally, it prompts investigation into how biases shape our expectations, and what methodologies or frameworks can be employed to continuously assess and broaden our understanding beyond personal and collective surprises.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often arise when we challenge our own assumptions and actively seek diverse perspectives. The next step is to systematically identify my core assumptions and biases by engaging with diverse viewpoints and exploring methodologies that encourage open-mindedness. This approach will help uncover surprising insights that enhance personal growth and contribute to a broader understanding.",
