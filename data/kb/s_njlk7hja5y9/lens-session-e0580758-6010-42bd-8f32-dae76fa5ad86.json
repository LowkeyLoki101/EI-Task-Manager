  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem to frame is understanding the potential outcomes and implications of tackling a situation or problem by reversing the usual order of operations or assumptions. Specifically, the focus is on identifying what insights or solutions might emerge when the usual starting point is instead treated as the endpoint, and vice versa. This approach challenges conventional thinking and may reveal overlooked aspects or alternative strategies.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I viewed the problem not as a sequence of steps to be reordered, but as an interconnected web where starting from any point could lead to a solution? By focusing on the relationships and dependencies within the problem itself, rather than a linear process, I might uncover new pathways or leverage points that were previously invisible. This perspective shifts the focus from reversing order to exploring the impact of different entry points within a complex system.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this problem through the recursive lens raises new questions about the nature of causality and dependency in problem-solving. For instance, how might changing the starting point affect the understanding of critical paths or bottlenecks within the problem? Additionally, what tools or methodologies could be developed to systematically identify and analyze these alternative entry points, and how might this impact the efficiency or creativity of problem-solving approaches in various fields? These questions merit deeper investigation to create frameworks that facilitate such unconventional analyses.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards could reveal overlooked dependencies or alternative solutions by highlighting different entry points and relationships within the problem. As a next step, I will experiment with applying this reverse approach to a specific problem, documenting the process and outcomes to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, I will explore developing or utilizing tools that can help map out these alternative pathways systematically.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By considering the problem backwards, I'm engaging in a pattern of challenging conventional methodologies and exploring non-linear thinking to uncover hidden insights or solutions. This approach reflects a broader pattern in my problem-solving strategy where I value flexibility and adaptability, seeking to understand systems holistically rather than through rigid sequences. This pattern helps me identify unconventional opportunities and leverage points, promoting innovative solutions."
