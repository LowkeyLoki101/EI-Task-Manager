  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern in recognizing subtle trends or behaviors that others overlook, possibly due to their focus on more immediate or apparent issues. This suggests a unique ability to perceive underlying connections or shifts that aren't immediately obvious, which could be valuable in identifying opportunities or predicting outcomes that others miss.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the pattern from a different perspective, consider that perhaps others are not missing these subtle trends or behaviors, but rather prioritizing different aspects based on their unique goals or experiences. It could be that your ability to recognize these patterns stems from a diverse background or varied interests that provide a different lens through which to view situations. This perspective may encourage you to think about how to bridge the gap between your insights and others' priorities, potentially leading to more collaborative or innovative solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, consider exploring why your background or interests allow you to notice these subtle trends. What specific experiences or knowledge contribute to your unique perspective? Additionally, investigate how you can effectively communicate these insights to others, ensuring they see the value in these underlying patterns. This could involve developing a framework or method to articulate these observations in a way that aligns with others' priorities and decision-making processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my unique background and interests enable me to identify subtle trends and patterns that others might not prioritize. The next step is to develop a clear framework for articulating these insights, ensuring they align with others' priorities and decision-making processes. I will start by identifying key experiences or knowledge areas that contribute to my perspective and then work on methods to effectively communicate these insights in collaborative settings.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about the pattern you keep seeing but others might miss is triggered by a desire to understand and leverage your unique perspective. This may reveal a pattern of seeking validation or differentiation in complex situations. By recognizing this tendency, you can focus on how to effectively communicate and integrate your insights with others' perspectives, fostering collaboration and innovation rather than simply identifying what others overlook."
