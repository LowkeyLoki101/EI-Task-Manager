  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by intentionally identifying and confronting questions I've avoided or overlooked, I can unlock areas for personal growth and address underlying fears or misconceptions.

This will involve identifying specific life aspects Iâ€™ve neglected and creating actionable steps to foster growth and change.",
