  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by identifying the specific outcomes or decisions we aim to influence, we can design or select a simulation model that effectively generates relevant data. The next step is to outline the key variables and scenarios that need exploration, and then research existing simulation tools or frameworks that can be adapted for our purpose. This will guide us in either modifying an existing model or developing a new one tailored to our needs.",
