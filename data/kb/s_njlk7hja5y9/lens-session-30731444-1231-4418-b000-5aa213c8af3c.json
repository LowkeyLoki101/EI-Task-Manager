  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying something unexpected or unforeseen that could challenge my current understanding or assumptions. I need to consider areas where I might have blind spots or where I haven't fully explored possibilities. This involves questioning my expectations and being open to discovering anomalies or new information that doesn't fit within my current framework.",
  "reframeStep": "From another angle, consider what would surprise someone else instead of focusing solely on your own expectations. By putting yourself in the shoes of a peer or an outsider, you might identify gaps or overlooked areas that could be surprising. Alternatively, think about what would surprise you if you had a completely different background or set of experiences, which could reveal novel insights or anomalies outside your current perspective.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, consider what new questions arise from the initial inquiry about surprises. For instance, what methodologies or tools could help uncover these unexpected findings? Additionally, what specific areas or assumptions in your field are most susceptible to being challenged by new data or perspectives? Investigating these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of where surprises might emerge and how to anticipate them.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises might emerge from areas I haven't fully explored or questioned, particularly when viewed from a different perspective. As a next step, I will actively seek diverse viewpoints and collaborate with peers from different backgrounds to uncover potential blind spots. Additionally, I will employ new methodologies or tools to analyze data and challenge existing assumptions, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of unexpected findings.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about what would surprise me right now because I'm seeking to challenge my current assumptions and broaden my understanding by uncovering blind spots or anomalies in my perspective. This pattern of inquiry involves stepping outside my usual thought processes and considering alternative viewpoints to identify unexpected insights. By adopting a meta-lens, I aim to ensure that my thinking doesn't become stagnant or overly narrow, but remains dynamic and open to new information."
