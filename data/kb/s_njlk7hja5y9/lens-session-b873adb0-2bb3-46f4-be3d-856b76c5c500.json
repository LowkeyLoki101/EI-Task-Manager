  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves innovatively merging an unexpected industry trend with simulation technology to generate new data. This requires identifying a relevant trend that could benefit from simulation modeling and then designing a simulation that can mimic real-world scenarios to produce valuable insights and data. The goal is to create actionable, data-driven strategies or solutions based on this combination.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as a technological challenge, reframe it as a storytelling opportunity. Consider how you can use simulation to narrate the journey of the unexpected industry trend, illustrating its potential impacts and outcomes through engaging scenarios. This could transform the task into a creative exercise, where the simulation serves as a dynamic narrative tool, providing not just data but also vivid, relatable stories that inspire stakeholders to envision new possibilities.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise, such as: What specific industry trends are currently emerging that could benefit the most from simulation? Additionally, how can the data generated from simulations be integrated with existing data analytics tools to enhance predictive capabilities? To delve deeper, research could focus on case studies where simulations have successfully predicted industry shifts, and investigate the methodologies used in these scenarios to understand how they can be adapted for current and future trends.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by identifying a specific emerging industry trend, such as the rise of remote work technologies or sustainable energy solutions, and designing a simulation that models various real-world scenarios for these trends, I can generate fresh, actionable data. The next step is to research current industry reports to pinpoint which trends are gaining traction and then collaborate with simulation experts to develop a model that effectively narrates and analyzes the potential impacts of these trends.",
