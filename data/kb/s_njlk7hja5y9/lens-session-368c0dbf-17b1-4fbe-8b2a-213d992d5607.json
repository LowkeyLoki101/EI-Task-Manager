  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a potentially overlooked question that could provide valuable insight or perspective. This involves reflecting on areas of life, goals, or personal development that haven't been recently examined. The aim is to uncover a question that could lead to meaningful introspection or growth.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of trying to identify a specific question you've overlooked, consider the perspective of what areas of your life you might be taking for granted or assuming are fine without scrutiny. Reframe the trigger to: \"What aspect of my life have I assumed doesn't need questioning?\" This shift encourages you to explore those parts of your life where complacency might have set in, potentially uncovering areas ripe for growth or improvement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" new lines of inquiry could include: \"What assumptions am I making about my current goals that might be outdated?\" or \"Which relationships have I not revisited or nurtured recently?\" These questions deserve deeper investigation as they could reveal underlying beliefs or areas in life that are due for reassessment, potentially leading to personal growth and stronger connections.",
  "closureStep": "In closing, my working hypothesis is that I've potentially overlooked aspects of my life where assumptions about stability or satisfaction may have led to complacency. My next step is to actively review areas such as personal goals and relationships, questioning whether my current assumptions still hold true. I will schedule time this week to reflect on these areas, jotting down any insights or changes needed to promote growth and improvement.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm thinking about this now because there's a recurring pattern in my approach where I focus primarily on the present challenges and immediate goals, often overlooking deeper, underlying areas that may need attention. This pattern suggests a tendency to prioritize tangible, short-term outcomes over more abstract, long-term introspection. Recognizing this, I should consciously allocate time to periodically reassess foundational aspects of my life, ensuring not to neglect areas where growth and reflection could be most impactful."
