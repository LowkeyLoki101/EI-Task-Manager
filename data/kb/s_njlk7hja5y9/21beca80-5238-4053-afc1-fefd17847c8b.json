  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will reveal alternative pathways and assumptions that are not immediately obvious in a forward-thinking process. The next step is to assemble a diverse team to collaboratively reverse-engineer the problem, starting from a clearly defined desired outcome. This action will help identify any hidden dependencies or innovative solutions that may streamline the solution process or open new avenues for exploration.",
