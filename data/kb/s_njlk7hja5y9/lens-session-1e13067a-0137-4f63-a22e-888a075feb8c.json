  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a recurring pattern that I notice but others do not. This could involve observing specific behaviors, trends, or anomalies in a given context that others overlook. The goal is to clearly articulate this pattern and understand why it might be unnoticed by others.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from a different perspective, consider the possibility that the pattern you are observing is not being missed by others, but rather is being interpreted differently based on their experiences and biases. Alternatively, the pattern might be so subtle or emerging that it requires a specific context or expertise to be recognized. By approaching this with curiosity, you can explore whether it's a communication gap or a difference in perspective that causes others to not see what you see.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "In applying the recursive lens, one might ask: What underlying factors contribute to my unique perspective in recognizing this pattern? Could there be unconscious biases or specific experiences shaping my observation? Additionally, it is worth investigating whether there are other contexts or fields where similar patterns are acknowledged, which could offer insights or validation. This prompts deeper research into cognitive biases, interdisciplinary analyses, and enhanced communication strategies to bridge any perceptual gaps with others.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I observe is either subtle or emerging, requiring specific expertise or context to be recognized. To address this, I will initiate discussions with peers in my field to share my observations and gather diverse perspectives. Additionally, I will conduct a literature review to see if similar patterns have been documented in other contexts, which could provide further insights or corroboration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern because I am often in situations where I notice details that others overlook, possibly due to my analytical mindset or my focus on specific data. This may be a repeated pattern in my approach, where I assume others aren't seeing what I see, rather than considering they might have a different focus or set of priorities. By reflecting on this, I can better understand if it's a matter of communication, perspective, or perhaps even a need to validate my observations with others."
