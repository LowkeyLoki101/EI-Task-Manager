  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to rethink the problem-solving process by starting with the desired outcome and tracing steps back to the current situation. This reverse approach could uncover overlooked assumptions, identify critical dependencies, and highlight alternative pathways that may not be apparent when tackling the problem in a conventional, forward manner. By framing the problem backwards, I can systematically deconstruct the necessary steps and potential obstacles that lead to the desired result.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of simply working backwards from the desired outcome, consider the problem from a lateral perspective by exploring analogous situations or industries where similar challenges have been successfully addressed. This shift in focus could introduce novel strategies or insights that aren't immediately obvious when solely reversing the problem. By applying solutions from different contexts, you might discover innovative approaches that can be adapted to fit your specific needs.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By approaching the problem backwards, new questions emerge such as: What assumptions are inherent in the current forward-thinking approach, and how might reversing these reveal hidden biases? Additionally, how can the insights gained from analogous situations be systematically integrated into this reversed framework to ensure a comprehensive understanding of potential solutions? Further investigation could involve researching case studies where backward reasoning has led to successful outcomes, as well as exploring cognitive science literature on the benefits and limitations of reverse problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can uncover hidden assumptions and biases while identifying alternative solutions that may not be evident through conventional methods. The next step is to conduct research into case studies and cognitive science literature on backward problem-solving to validate this approach. Additionally, I'll explore analogous situations that have been successfully addressed in different industries to gain further insights and strategies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this problem backwards right now to challenge conventional problem-solving patterns and to potentially reveal hidden assumptions or new insights. This approach reflects a pattern of seeking alternative perspectives to gain a deeper understanding and uncover novel solutions. By consistently questioning traditional methods and being open to unconventional strategies, I aim to enhance creativity and effectiveness in problem-solving."
