  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to explore the potential of generating fresh and innovative prompts by rearranging or combining elements from existing ones. This involves looking at your current prompts as modular building blocks that can be shuffled to inspire new insights or creative directions. The goal is to discover unexpected connections or questions that may not have been apparent in their original configuration.",
  "reframeStep": "What if you viewed your prompts as dynamic narratives rather than static elements? By considering them as parts of evolving stories, shuffling them could create entirely new plotlines or character developments. This perspective shifts the focus from merely generating new prompts to crafting unique journeys that invite exploration and engagement in unforeseen ways.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying themes or concepts present in your existing prompts that could be explored further when combined in new ways? How might shuffling these prompts reveal gaps in your current thinking or highlight areas that deserve deeper investigation? Additionally, could this process of shuffling prompts lead to the development of a systematic method for generating innovative ideas across different domains?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my existing prompts can lead to novel insights and creative breakthroughs by revealing hidden themes and connections. The next step is to systematically rearrange these prompts, perhaps using a randomization tool or algorithm, and observe the outcomes. I'll document any new ideas that emerge and assess their potential for deeper exploration or application across different domains.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, you're considering the broader motivation behind shuffling prompts: a desire for innovation and breaking free from routine patterns of thought. This reflects a pattern of seeking novelty and creativity, suggesting you regularly challenge existing frameworks to uncover fresh perspectives. Understanding this can guide you to consciously incorporate more structured methods of exploration, ensuring that the process of reimagining prompts remains productive and not just experimental."
