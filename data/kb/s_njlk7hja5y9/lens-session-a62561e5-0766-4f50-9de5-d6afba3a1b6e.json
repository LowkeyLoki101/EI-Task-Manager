  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea to frame is the element of surprise in discovering something unexpected. Specifically, I see the challenge of identifying what genuinely surprises me, which may involve uncovering hidden assumptions or unrecognized biases in my current understanding or expectations. The goal is to clearly articulate what those surprising elements might be and how they challenge my current perspective.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the idea that surprise often stems from a gap between expectation and reality. Instead of focusing solely on what you might find, reframe the question to explore the assumptions you hold about what is unlikely or impossible. By identifying these preconceived notions, you can better understand what would truly surprise you and why, thus highlighting areas ripe for discovery or new learning.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the question of surprise recursively prompts an inquiry into the underlying assumptions that shape my expectations. What specific beliefs do I hold about the world that, if proven inaccurate, would lead to surprise? This further leads to investigating the origins of these beliefs, questioning their validity, and considering the broader implications of discovering new truths that challenge established paradigms.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I would be genuinely surprised to discover evidence that fundamentally contradicts my deeply held beliefs or assumptions about a particular topic, such as human behavior or technological possibilities. As a next step, I will actively seek out perspectives and research that challenge my current views, keeping an open mind to identify and reflect on any unexpected findings that arise. This approach will help me uncover potential blind spots and deepen my understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because surprise plays a crucial role in learning and innovation by challenging my existing beliefs and assumptions. The pattern here is my tendency to operate within established expectations, which can limit my openness to unexpected insights. By consciously seeking out potential surprises, I aim to break this pattern and cultivate a mindset more receptive to novelty and growth."
