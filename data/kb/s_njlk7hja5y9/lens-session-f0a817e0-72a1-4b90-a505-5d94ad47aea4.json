  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is considering the consequences and potential outcomes of tackling a problem from its conclusion or expected result, rather than starting from its current state or the beginning. By approaching the problem backwards, we aim to identify what steps and decisions would lead us to the desired end state. This approach could reveal overlooked solutions or highlight assumptions that need reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "Approaching the problem backwards could be reframed as \"reverse engineering the solution.\" By doing so, we shift our focus to understanding the necessary conditions and actions that must have occurred to achieve the desired outcome. This perspective emphasizes the importance of clear goal-setting and allows us to work through potential obstacles from a more informed standpoint, potentially uncovering innovative paths forward.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively examining the idea of reverse engineering a problem, we can explore questions such as: What specific methodologies or tools are most effective for reverse engineering in various fields? How does this approach impact problem-solving efficiency in complex systems compared to traditional methods? Further research could delve into case studies where reverse engineering has successfully led to innovative solutions, as well as potential pitfalls or limitations of this strategy.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that reverse engineering this problem will reveal new insights and potentially overlooked solutions by identifying the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome. The next step is to clearly define the end goal and systematically work backwards to outline the required conditions and actions. I'll select a specific problem to apply this approach to and evaluate its effectiveness compared to traditional methods.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By considering approaching the problem backwards, I'm exploring alternative problem-solving strategies that might reveal hidden insights or overlooked opportunities. This pattern reflects a desire to challenge conventional methods and uncover innovative solutions by re-evaluating assumptions and focusing on outcomes. This approach prompts a shift towards goal-oriented thinking, encouraging me to question the effectiveness of traditional linear approaches and potentially improve my problem-solving toolkit."
