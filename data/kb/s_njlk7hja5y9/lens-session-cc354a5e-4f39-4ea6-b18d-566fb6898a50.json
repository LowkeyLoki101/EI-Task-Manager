  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a situation is correct without questioning it. This could be leading to potential blind spots or errors in judgment. It's important to identify and challenge these assumptions to ensure they align with reality and don't hinder progress or decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I reframe the situation by considering that my assumptions might not necessarily be wrong, but rather incomplete? Instead of focusing solely on the possibility of being incorrect, I could approach this by exploring what additional information or perspectives I might be missing. This shift from identifying errors to seeking a fuller understanding can open up new avenues for learning and improve decision-making.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By examining the assumption that my understanding might be wrong, further questions emerge: What specific areas of my current belief might lack evidence or be based on outdated information? How can I systematically test these assumptions to validate or revise them? Additionally, what new perspectives or expert insights could I seek to enrich my understanding and ensure that my assumptions are as comprehensive and current as possible? These inquiries warrant deeper investigation to refine beliefs and enhance decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumptions may be incomplete rather than entirely wrong. The next step is to actively seek out additional information and diverse perspectives that can either support or challenge my current beliefs. I will engage with experts, gather relevant data, and remain open to revising my assumptions as new insights emerge.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I often find myself caught in a loop of seeking validation for my current beliefs, which can create blind spots. This pattern of focusing on identifying wrong assumptions might stem from a desire to avoid mistakes, but it can also narrow my perspective. By stepping back, I see an opportunity to routinely integrate a broader range of insights and embrace uncertainty as a catalyst for deeper understanding and growth."
