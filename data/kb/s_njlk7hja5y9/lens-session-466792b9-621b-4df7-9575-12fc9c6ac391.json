  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a situation is correct without questioning its validity. This assumption might be leading me to overlook potential errors or alternative perspectives that could change my approach or outcome. I need to identify specific assumptions I hold and evaluate their accuracy to ensure they align with reality.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of assuming that my understanding is correct, I could approach the situation from the perspective of a beginner, embracing a mindset of curiosity and openness to new information. By doing so, I might uncover alternative viewpoints or insights that challenge my initial assumptions. This shift allows me to actively seek out diverse opinions and evidence that could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the assumption that my understanding might be incorrect, new questions emerge such as: What specific areas of my knowledge are most susceptible to error, and how can I systematically investigate them? Additionally, how can I cultivate a habit of continuously questioning my assumptions to prevent complacency? These questions warrant deeper research into cognitive biases and strategies for fostering a mindset that prioritizes critical thinking and lifelong learning.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by actively questioning my assumptions and embracing a mindset of curiosity, I can uncover potential errors and gain a more accurate understanding of various situations. As a next step, I will identify specific assumptions I hold in a current project or decision, and actively seek out diverse perspectives and evidence that challenge these assumptions. This will involve consulting with peers, reading opposing viewpoints, or conducting experiments to test my assumptions' validity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about challenging my assumptions right now because I recognize a pattern of relying on my initial beliefs without sufficient scrutiny, which could limit my understanding and decision-making. By applying a meta-lens, I am trying to break this pattern and create a habit of regularly questioning and validating my assumptions to foster a more open and informed mindset. This approach encourages continuous learning and adaptability in various situations."
