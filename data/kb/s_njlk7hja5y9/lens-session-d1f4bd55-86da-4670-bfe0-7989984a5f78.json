  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying potentially incorrect assumptions that could be influencing my decisions or perspectives. I need to pinpoint specific beliefs or ideas I hold that may not be based on accurate information or may be outdated. By clearly identifying these assumptions, I can begin to question their validity and explore alternative viewpoints or data that might better inform my understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, what if you approached this by considering what assumptions you're not even aware you are making? By shifting the perspective to uncovering hidden or unconscious assumptions, you open the door to discovering new areas of improvement and insight. This might lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying beliefs that guide your thinking and decision-making processes.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring hidden or unconscious assumptions, new questions arise such as: What cognitive biases could be influencing my assumptions without my awareness? How do cultural, social, or personal experiences shape these underlying beliefs? These questions deserve deeper investigation to uncover the roots of implicit assumptions and to develop strategies for identifying and mitigating their impact on decision-making.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I have unconscious assumptions shaped by cognitive biases and personal experiences that I have yet to fully identify. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from trusted colleagues or mentors to gain an outside perspective on my decision-making processes and assumptions. Additionally, I will engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or mindfulness, to increase my awareness of these hidden assumptions and their potential impacts.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about identifying potentially incorrect assumptions because I want to ensure my decisions and perspectives are well-informed and accurate. This approach reflects a pattern of self-scrutiny and a desire for continuous improvement in my thinking. By stepping back with a meta-lens, I recognize that this pattern might limit me by focusing too much on potential errors rather than fostering a broader exploration of novel ideas and perspectives that could enrich my understanding."
