  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the patterns I observe might be overlooked by others due to differences in focus or communication barriers. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from peers on my observations to better understand their perspectives and refine the way I communicate these insights. Additionally, I will explore developing more structured methods to present and validate these patterns, potentially through data visualization or collaborative discussions, to make them more accessible and persuasive.",
