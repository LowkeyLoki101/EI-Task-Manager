  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely an issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable, such as a personal relationship conflict, a career decision, or a financial challenge. By not addressing it, I might be experiencing increased anxiety or stress, which can further exacerbate the situation. It's important to identify this issue clearly and consider practical steps to address it to alleviate the burden.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't actually as overwhelming as it seems, but rather an opportunity for growth and learning? By reframing it as a chance to build resilience and enhance my problem-solving skills, I can approach this issue with curiosity and openness, potentially finding creative solutions that I hadn't considered before. This shift in perspective could transform the problem into a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to this trigger leads to new questions: What smaller, underlying issues contribute to the larger problem I'm avoiding? How might my past experiences or beliefs be influencing my avoidance behavior? Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate what specific emotions or fears arise when I attempt to address this problem, as understanding these elements could offer insights into effective strategies for tackling the issue.",
  "closureStep": "My current working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is a personal relationship conflict. As a next step, I will set aside time this week to reflect on the specific aspects of the relationship that are causing discomfort. I will then choose one actionable step, such as initiating a conversation or seeking advice, to begin addressing the issue directly.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it has likely been a recurring source of stress or discomfort that I haven't fully confronted. This pattern of avoidance might stem from a fear of failure, uncertainty, or past experiences where addressing similar issues didn't yield positive outcomes. By recognizing this tendency, I can start to break the cycle by setting small, manageable goals to gradually face the problem, thereby reducing its emotional weight and impact on my well-being."
