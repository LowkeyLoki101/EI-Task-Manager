  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I am avoiding is rooted in a specific fear or belief that needs addressing. The next step is to identify and articulate the exact issue and any associated fears, then create a concrete action plan to tackle it. This could involve setting small, manageable goals, seeking advice or support, and reflecting on progress regularly to ensure I'm moving towards resolution.",
