  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts and intentionally synthesizing them can lead to meaningful insights and innovations. The next step is to create a system or tool for shuffling prompts, perhaps using software or a physical card deck, and test it in creative writing workshops or brainstorming sessions. This will help evaluate its effectiveness in fostering creativity and critical thinking.",
