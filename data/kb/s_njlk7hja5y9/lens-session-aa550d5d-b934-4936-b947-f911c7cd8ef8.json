  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain insights or trends seem obvious to me, but others around me don't seem to notice or acknowledge them. This could be due to differences in focus, perspective, or background knowledge. The problem might lie in effectively communicating these observations or validating whether they are indeed significant and overlooked by others.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the trigger, consider the possibility that others may not be missing these insights or trends at all, but rather valuing different aspects of the situation that you might overlook. Alternatively, the perceived lack of recognition could stem from communication barriers or differences in how evidence is interpreted. This shift in perspective suggests exploring how to better understand others' viewpoints and improve collaborative dialogue to bridge these gaps.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the original trigger prompts further exploration into the specific patterns you notice and why they might be overlooked by others. Questions to consider include: What are the characteristics of these patterns, and how do they connect to broader trends or insights? Additionally, it may be valuable to investigate the methods you use to identify these patternsâ€”could they be refined or expanded to make your observations more accessible or persuasive to others?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the patterns I observe might be overlooked by others due to differences in focus or communication barriers. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from peers on my observations to better understand their perspectives and refine the way I communicate these insights. Additionally, I will explore developing more structured methods to present and validate these patterns, potentially through data visualization or collaborative discussions, to make them more accessible and persuasive.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this trigger through a meta-lens, I'm considering why I perceive these patterns as overlooked by others. This reflection might reveal a tendency to assume my perspective is more comprehensive or insightful, which could stem from my own biases or cognitive habits. Recognizing this, I should focus on fostering open discussions to validate these patterns collaboratively, ensuring diverse perspectives are considered and communicated effectively."
