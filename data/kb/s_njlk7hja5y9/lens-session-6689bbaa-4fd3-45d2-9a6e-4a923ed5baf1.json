  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that will captivate and engage the target audience. This involves understanding current trends, audience interests, and how they intersect with the brand’s message. The goal is to craft a narrative that resonates emotionally and stands out amidst the digital noise.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on finding a story hook, consider the perspective of the audience as participants in the narrative. What if the content invited them to co-create the story, allowing them to share their experiences or perspectives related to the brand? This could transform the marketing approach from storytelling to story-building, fostering a deeper connection and engagement with the audience.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the concept of story-building, what platforms or technologies can facilitate real-time audience interaction and participation in co-creating content? Additionally, what metrics can be used to measure the effectiveness of participatory content in terms of engagement and brand loyalty? Investigating these questions may reveal innovative approaches and tools that can be integrated into the marketing strategy to enhance audience involvement and storytelling impact.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a participatory story-building campaign that engages the audience by inviting them to share their personal stories or experiences related to the brand. The next step is to select a platform that supports interactive content creation, such as social media with interactive features or a dedicated microsite, and to outline the campaign structure, including prompts for audience participation. Additionally, I will establish metrics for measuring engagement and the impact on brand loyalty to assess the campaign's success.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because I’m striving to create marketing content that not only informs but also emotionally connects with the audience, recognizing the importance of engagement in today’s competitive digital landscape. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing heavily on crafting a standalone narrative, rather than considering innovative approaches like involving the audience as co-creators, which could yield more dynamic and interactive content. This reflection prompts me to consider broader, participatory storytelling strategies to enhance audience involvement."
