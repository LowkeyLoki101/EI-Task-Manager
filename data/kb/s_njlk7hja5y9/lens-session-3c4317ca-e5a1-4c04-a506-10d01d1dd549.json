  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a task or situation that causes discomfort, anxiety, or uncertainty, leading me to procrastinate or ignore it. It could be a difficult conversation I need to have, a decision I need to make, or a responsibility I am neglecting. By framing this issue, I need to identify and acknowledge it clearly to understand why I am avoiding it and how it impacts my life.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't just about discomfort or anxiety, but rather about a deeper fear of change or failure? By looking at it from this angle, I can explore whether my avoidance stems from a fear of not meeting expectations or disrupting the status quo. This perspective allows me to consider the potential growth and opportunities that confronting this problem could bring, rather than just focusing on the immediate discomfort.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying beliefs or past experiences contribute to my fear of change or failure, and how do these shape my current avoidance behavior? Additionally, what strategies can I develop to gradually confront these fears, and what small, actionable steps can I take to test the waters of change or address potential failures constructively? Exploring these questions could reveal deeper patterns in my behavior and help me devise more effective ways to manage and overcome avoidance.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is related to a fear of change or failure, influenced by underlying beliefs or past experiences. As a next step, I will identify one specific task or decision I've been putting off and break it down into small, manageable actions. I'll start by dedicating a set amount of time each day to work on it, while also reflecting on any fears that arise during the process to better understand and address them.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying the meta-lens, I'm considering why I am currently focusing on identifying the problem I am avoiding. This reflection may reveal a recurring pattern of avoidance in my approach to challenges, possibly driven by fear or anxiety. By understanding this pattern, I can develop strategies to address not just the immediate problem, but also the underlying habits that lead to avoidance, ultimately fostering personal growth and resilience."
