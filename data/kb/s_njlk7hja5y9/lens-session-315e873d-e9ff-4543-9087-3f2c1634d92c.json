  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to determine which type of simulation can be executed to generate new, useful data. We need to identify the objective of the data collection and the parameters of the simulation, such as the domain (e.g., weather patterns, financial markets, or social behaviors) and the specific variables or conditions to model. This will guide the development of a simulation that meets our data needs effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on generating new data through a simulation, consider whether existing data could be augmented or extrapolated to serve your needs. This alternative perspective involves analyzing current data sets to identify patterns or trends that could be expanded upon through data augmentation techniques, thereby potentially reducing the need for a full-scale simulation. Additionally, consider leveraging collaborative simulations that incorporate real-world data inputs from multiple sources, allowing for a more comprehensive data generation process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the key variables or conditions that should be prioritized in the simulation to ensure the data aligns with our objectives? Are there existing simulation frameworks or models in our domain that could be adapted or expanded for our purposes? Additionally, how can we validate the accuracy and reliability of the simulated data and ensure it integrates well with any existing datasets we plan to augment?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that running a simulation focused on the key variables and conditions identified in our objectives will effectively generate the new data we need. The next step is to select or develop a simulation framework within our domain that can be adapted to model these variables, ensuring it can be validated for accuracy and reliability. Additionally, we should explore opportunities to integrate this simulation with existing datasets to enhance its value and applicability.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about creating new data through simulations right now because there's a need to explore scenarios or variables not covered by existing data sets. This reflects a pattern of seeking proactive solutions to gaps in information, often driven by a desire for innovation or deeper insight. However, it's crucial to periodically reassess whether this approach is necessary or if existing data augmentation methods could achieve similar outcomes more efficiently."
