  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards or iteratively can uncover hidden assumptions and reveal alternative solutions that aren't visible with a forward-only approach. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work backwards to identify each step, noting any assumptions and dependencies along the way. I will also establish a feedback loop to continuously refine the approach based on insights gained from each iteration.",
