  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is to identify what unexpected discoveries might exist that would catch me off guard. I need to consider areas or topics where my assumptions or knowledge gaps could lead to surprise. This involves examining situations, information, or outcomes that challenge my current beliefs or understanding.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on areas where my assumptions might be challenged, I could reframe the trigger to explore what surprises might arise in areas I consider well-understood or predictable. This involves questioning the status quo and looking for unexpected elements or innovations in familiar environments, which could uncover hidden complexities or opportunities for growth. By examining the familiar with a fresh perspective, I might discover surprising insights that were previously overlooked.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What assumptions underlie my understanding of familiar topics, and how can they be tested for unexpected outcomes? Additionally, what methodologies or lenses could be applied to other areas of interest to identify surprising elements? This warrants deeper investigation into the cognitive biases that influence our perceptions of the familiar and exploring interdisciplinary approaches that might reveal unexpected insights.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries are most likely to occur in areas where I have strong preconceived notions or where I haven't recently questioned the status quo. The next step is to actively seek out information or perspectives in these areas that challenge my current understanding. This includes engaging with diverse viewpoints, conducting experiments, or exploring interdisciplinary approaches to uncover hidden complexities or opportunities for innovation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this with a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a personal tendency to seek unexpected insights primarily in unfamiliar areas, potentially overlooking surprises in familiar domains. This reflects a pattern of compartmentalizing my curiosity, which might limit opportunities for innovation or revelation in well-trodden areas. By understanding this, I can intentionally broaden my scope to include the familiar in my quest for the surprising, thus diversifying my exploratory approach."
