  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that AI in the energy sector will predominantly lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced decision-making. If I consider the reverse, where AI might introduce complexities, inefficiencies, or even increase costs due to implementation challenges or unforeseen issues, the outcome would shift towards a more cautious and critical evaluation of AI deployments. This would involve more rigorous testing, contingency planning, and a balanced approach to integrating AI technologies.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the assumption that AI in the energy sector is primarily seen as a tool for innovation and progress. Reframing this, we could view AI as a potential disruptor to traditional practices and job roles, causing resistance or slow adoption due to fears of obsolescence or loss of control. This angle shifts the focus towards addressing human and organizational factors, emphasizing the need for transparent communication, retraining programs, and fostering a culture that values both technological advancement and human expertise.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, we can ask: What specific complexities or inefficiencies might AI introduce in the energy sector, and how can these be systematically identified and addressed? Further exploration could involve investigating case studies where AI integration in energy led to unexpected outcomes, and researching strategies for risk management and mitigation when deploying AI technologies. Additionally, we should examine how different sectors within the energy industry might uniquely experience these challenges and what targeted solutions could be developed.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI promises significant benefits in the energy sector, it also has the potential to disrupt existing systems and introduce new challenges. To address this, my next step is to conduct a comprehensive review of case studies and research to identify specific instances of AI-induced complexities in the energy sector. Based on these findings, I will develop a framework for risk management and mitigation strategies tailored to different segments of the energy industry.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this assumption now because there's a prevalent narrative that AI will inherently improve efficiency and innovation in the energy sector, and I want to challenge that view to ensure a more comprehensive understanding. The pattern I'm repeating is an inclination to focus on technological benefits while potentially overlooking the complexities and human elements involved, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that includes both opportunities and potential drawbacks of AI integration."
