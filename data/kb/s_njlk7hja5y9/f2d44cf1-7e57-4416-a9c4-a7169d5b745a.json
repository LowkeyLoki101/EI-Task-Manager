  "topic": "Strategies for uncovering and addressing unconscious assumptions in business",
  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that I have unconscious assumptions shaped by cognitive biases and personal experiences that I have yet to fully identify. As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from trusted colleagues or mentors to gain an outside perspective on my decision-making processes and assumptions. Additionally, I will engage in reflective practices, such as journaling or mindfulness, to increase my awareness of these hidden assumptions and their potential impacts.",
