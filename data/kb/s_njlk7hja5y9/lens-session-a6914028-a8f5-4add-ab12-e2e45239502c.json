  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern in the way certain problems or trends manifest, yet others seem to overlook these connections or fail to recognize them as significant. This could involve noticing specific behaviors, market trends, or inefficiencies that consistently arise but are not widely acknowledged or addressed. By framing this pattern clearly, I can better communicate its importance and potential implications to others who might be missing it.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider that the recurring pattern you notice might be a reflection of your unique experiences or biases that others do not share. This could mean that instead of the pattern being universally significant, it might hold particular relevance only in certain contexts or to specific audiences. To reframe, explore how you can leverage this perspective to identify niche opportunities or insights that align with your unique viewpoint, rather than expecting universal recognition or validation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "When viewing this pattern through a recursive lens, consider exploring whether this pattern is part of a larger system or interconnected with broader trends that warrant further investigation. Ask whether the pattern's repetition indicates an underlying cause or principle that could be researched in-depth. Additionally, delve into how this pattern has evolved over time and whether it might forecast future developments or shifts, which could be crucial for anticipating and strategically planning for upcoming changes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the recurring pattern I notice is part of a larger, interconnected system that may hold untapped opportunities. As a next step, I will conduct a thorough analysis to understand its underlying causes and broader implications, possibly seeking input from others with diverse perspectives to refine my understanding. This approach will help me identify niche opportunities or strategic insights that can be leveraged for future developments.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, I'm recognizing that my focus on identifying patterns others might miss stems from a desire to offer unique insights and add value through differentiation. This approach might be a repeat pattern itself, where I consistently seek out anomalies or overlooked details to feel impactful or validated. To address this, I should consider whether there's a balance in my approach, ensuring that I'm not just identifying patterns for the sake of distinction but also validating their broader relevance or applicability."
