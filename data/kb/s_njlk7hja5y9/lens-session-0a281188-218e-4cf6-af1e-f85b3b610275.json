  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see the opportunity to explore a unique story hook by identifying a surprising pattern in solar technology adoption or innovation that has been overlooked. Specifically, the focus could be on an unconventional use of solar technology in an unexpected industry or region, revealing untapped potential or a novel application that challenges current perceptions. This could uncover how solar technology is catalyzing unexpected changes or advancements in areas not traditionally associated with renewable energy.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from another angle, consider examining the cultural and social shifts driven by solar technology adoption in remote or indigenous communities. Instead of focusing solely on technological innovation, explore how solar energy is transforming lifestyles, empowering women, or fostering educational opportunities in these areas. This shift in perspective highlights the human and social dimensions of solar technology, providing a compelling narrative about its broader impact beyond just the environmental benefits.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, new questions arise about the long-term socio-economic impacts of solar technology in unconventional settings. How might solar technology not only alter energy consumption patterns but also influence political dynamics or economic structures in these regions? Further investigation could delve into how solar technology adoption is reshaping local economies, potentially leading to shifts in power balances or creating new market opportunities that were previously unimaginable.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that solar technology is driving unexpected socio-economic transformations in remote or indigenous communities, offering a unique story hook that others might be missing. As a next step, I will research specific case studies where solar adoption has led to significant cultural, educational, or economic shifts, focusing on how these changes are altering traditional power dynamics and creating new opportunities. This research will help develop a compelling narrative that highlights the broader, often overlooked impacts of solar technology.",
