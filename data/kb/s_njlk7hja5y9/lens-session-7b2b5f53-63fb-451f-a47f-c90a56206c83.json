  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a significant question that I have neglected to consider recently, which may lead to insights or personal growth. I need to pinpoint an area of my life or thinking that I have overlooked, which could benefit from reflection or reassessment. This involves examining various aspects such as personal goals, relationships, health, or career to uncover any neglected questions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on identifying a neglected question in a specific area of my life, I took a broader approach and considered questions that challenge my current beliefs or assumptions? By looking at it from this angle, I could uncover questions that push me out of my comfort zone, prompting me to consider alternative perspectives or new possibilities I haven't yet explored. This might involve questioning my core values, the status quo, or the routines I take for granted.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying reasons for neglecting certain questions, and how do these reasons impact my personal growth? Additionally, how might revisiting these neglected questions influence my current decision-making or future trajectory? Exploring these areas could lead to a deeper understanding of my priorities and potential areas for development or change.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I tend to neglect questions that challenge my current beliefs, assumptions, or comfort zones. As a next step, I will set aside time each week to reflect on one assumption I hold and consider questions that could offer new perspectives or insights. This practice aims to foster personal growth by encouraging me to reevaluate my priorities and explore potential changes in my thinking or actions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because revisiting neglected questions can lead to personal growth and self-discovery. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on the familiar areas of my life for improvement, rather than challenging deeper, possibly uncomfortable beliefs or assumptions. By recognizing this pattern, I can intentionally seek out questions that disrupt my usual thinking and encourage a more expansive perspective."
