  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a type of simulation that can generate new, useful data for our needs. Key considerations include the objectives of the data collection, the variables involved, and the potential scenarios or models that could be simulated to create this data. It involves deciding on parameters like the scope of the simulation, the tools or software required, and ensuring the data generated aligns with our goals.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on running a new simulation, consider leveraging existing data and simulations to enhance or combine with new elements, creating a hybrid model. By integrating past data with new variables or scenarios, you might uncover insights that purely new data wouldn't reveal. This approach could not only save resources but also provide a richer context for the data generated.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific gaps or limitations in our current data could a new simulation address? How might different simulation methodologies, such as agent-based modeling or Monte Carlo simulations, provide unique insights? Additionally, what are the ethical and practical implications of generating new data through simulations, and how can we ensure the validity and reliability of this simulated data in decision-making processes?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a hybrid simulation approach, combining existing data with new variables through methodologies like agent-based modeling or Monte Carlo simulations, could effectively address gaps in our current data. The next step is to identify specific variables and scenarios that are underrepresented in our current data set and select the appropriate simulation tools to integrate these new elements. I will also evaluate the ethical and practical implications to ensure that the simulated data is valid and reliable for decision-making.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because there's a need to generate data that can support decision-making or provide insights for a specific problem. This pattern of seeking new simulations might indicate a habitual focus on creating data from scratch, rather than utilizing existing resources. By stepping back, I can recognize the potential for optimizing existing data and simulations, which may lead to more efficient and innovative solutions."
