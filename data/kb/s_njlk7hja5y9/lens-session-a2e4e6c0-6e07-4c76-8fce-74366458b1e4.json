  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is identifying a question that I have neglected or overlooked asking myself recently. This involves reflecting on areas of my life or mindset that I might not have consciously examined, perhaps due to routine, complacency, or avoidance. The goal is to uncover a potentially valuable question that could lead to personal growth or insight.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked myself, I consider what assumptions I'm making about my life that I haven't recently challenged? This perspective shifts the focus from seeking a new question to examining the beliefs and assumptions that underpin my daily decisions and attitudes. By identifying and questioning these underlying assumptions, I may uncover areas for personal growth and deeper insight that I hadn't previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" recursively, we might deepen our investigation by asking, \"What areas of my life have I been avoiding reflecting on, and why?\" or \"How do my unexamined assumptions shape my interactions and decisions?\" These questions prompt a deeper dive into understanding the subconscious influences on our behavior and decision-making, which can lead to uncovering hidden biases or unexplored opportunities for growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by examining the assumptions I've been making about my life, I may uncover areas that need reflection and questioning. The next step is to intentionally set aside time for journaling or meditation to explore these assumptions and identify any that have gone unchallenged. This reflective practice will help in discovering potentially transformative questions I might not have considered recently.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because it represents an opportunity to break free from habitual thinking and explore areas of personal growth that might be overlooked. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on familiar, comfortable questions and assumptions without challenging them, potentially limiting my ability to gain new insights or make meaningful changes. This reflection can help identify areas where I might be stagnating and encourage a more dynamic and reflective mindset."
