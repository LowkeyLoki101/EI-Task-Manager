  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption being made is that AI will predominantly have a positive impact on the energy sector, leading to increased efficiency and sustainability. By considering the reverse, one might explore the potential for AI to introduce challenges such as increased complexity, cybersecurity risks, or unequal access to benefits, which could hinder progress or exacerbate existing issues in the sector.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on the assumption that AI will bring either predominantly positive or negative impacts, we consider the possibility that AI's role in the energy sector is neutral but highly dependent on human governance and decision-making? By shifting the perspective to human influence, it emphasizes the importance of policy-making, ethical considerations, and strategic implementation in shaping AI's impact, suggesting that the real challenge lies in how society chooses to harness AI capabilities. This approach could lead to more balanced discussions and proactive measures to maximize benefits while mitigating risks.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this further, new questions arise such as: How can policy frameworks be developed to ensure AI in the energy sector is used ethically and equitably? What are the specific cybersecurity challenges AI faces in this field, and how can they be mitigated? Additionally, it could be valuable to investigate case studies where AI implementation in energy has led to unintended negative consequences, to understand how such challenges were addressed and what lessons can be learned for future AI governance.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that AI's impact in the energy sector is neutral and largely contingent on human governance and decision-making. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of existing policy frameworks and case studies where AI has been implemented, to identify successful governance strategies and areas needing improvement. This will inform actionable recommendations for policymakers and industry leaders to effectively harness AI's potential while mitigating risks.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because it’s crucial to challenge my assumptions and explore alternative perspectives to better understand AI's impact on the energy sector. This pattern reflects a tendency to initially view technological advancements in a binary light—either as solutions or problems—without fully considering the nuanced role of human governance and decision-making. By stepping back, I can adopt a more holistic approach that acknowledges the complexity of integrating AI into energy systems and the importance of strategic human intervention."
