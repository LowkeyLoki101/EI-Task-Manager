  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can identify overlooked steps or assumptions in the original strategy, leading to more innovative and efficient solutions. As a next step, I will outline the desired outcome and reverse-engineer the process to map out each step needed to achieve it. Additionally, I will research examples of successful reverse-engineering in similar contexts to inform and refine my approach.",
