  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a unique angle on solar technology that hasn't been widely covered. I see an opportunity to explore an unexpected trend or application in solar tech, such as its integration with emerging technologies or its impact on unconventional industries, which could reveal a captivating narrative. The aim is to uncover a pattern or innovation that challenges common perceptions or usage of solar technology.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the technology itself, reframe the exploration to consider the human and cultural dimensions of solar technology adoption. What if the unique story hook lies in the unexpected ways communities around the world are creatively integrating solar technology into their daily lives and traditions? By shifting the perspective from technical advancements to the social and cultural transformations enabled by solar power, you might uncover a compelling narrative about resilience, adaptation, and innovation in places where solar technology is redefining lifestyles and economies.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the human and cultural dimensions of solar technology adoption prompts further questions: How are traditional practices being adapted or transformed by solar innovations in different cultures? What unexpected social dynamics or community structures have emerged around the adoption of solar energy? These inquiries deserve deeper research, such as ethnographic studies or interviews with community leaders, to uncover stories of resilience and adaptation driven by solar technology in diverse global contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in the intersection of solar technology and cultural transformation across different global communities. The next step is to conduct detailed research, including ethnographic studies and interviews, to gather stories from diverse regions where solar technology is influencing traditional practices and community dynamics in unexpected ways. This approach will help uncover compelling narratives of adaptation and innovation driven by solar technology.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because there is a drive to uncover untapped narratives in the rapidly evolving field of solar technology, potentially offering fresh insights and stories to an audience increasingly interested in sustainable innovation. The pattern I'm repeating is a tendency to focus on technical advancements, which may overlook the human and cultural narratives that could provide a richer, more engaging story. By stepping back to consider broader social implications and diverse applications, I might discover more compelling angles that resonate on a deeper level with audiences."
