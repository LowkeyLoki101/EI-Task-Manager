  "trigger": "How might I approach a problem by combining an unexpected industry trend with a simulation for fresh data creation?",
  "frameStep": "I see a challenge in integrating an emerging industry trend, which might not have extensive historical data, with a simulation model to generate new, relevant data. The problem involves identifying a suitable trend, understanding its key characteristics, and designing a simulation that accurately reflects its potential impacts and variations. The goal is to create a robust dataset that can inform decision-making or strategy development in this new context.",
  "reframeStep": "What if we approached this problem by first seeking inspiration from industries that have successfully navigated similar challenges? Instead of focusing solely on the emerging trend and simulation, consider examining crossover applications where different sectors have adapted unexpected trends using innovative simulations. This could reveal novel methodologies and insights that can be adapted or combined to address the current challenge, leading to more comprehensive and creative data generation strategies.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this further, what specific methodologies have different industries used to successfully simulate data for emerging trends, and how can these be adapted or combined for our context? Additionally, how can we identify key indicators within the trend that are most amenable to simulation and data generation? It may also be worth investigating emerging technologies or tools that facilitate dynamic simulations, especially those adept at handling uncertainties inherent in new industry trends.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by analyzing methodologies from industries that have effectively used simulations to adapt to emerging trends, I can identify best practices and tools suitable for my context. Next, I will conduct a focused research initiative to gather case studies and explore dynamic simulation technologies that accommodate the uncertainties of new industry trends. This will guide the design of a simulation model tailored to generate relevant and robust datasets for the trend in focus.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this because I am curious about innovating within my industry by leveraging emerging trends in a novel way, and there's a recurring pattern in my approach where I tend to focus on exploring new methodologies and interdisciplinary applications. I often seek to combine disparate concepts to uncover unique solutions, and this pattern reflects a broader desire to stay ahead of the curve by integrating cutting-edge ideas with practical tools like simulations."
