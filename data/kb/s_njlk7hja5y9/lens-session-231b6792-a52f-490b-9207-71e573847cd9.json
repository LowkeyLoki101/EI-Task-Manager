  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "Framing the problem as approaching it backwards involves identifying the end goal or desired outcome first and then working in reverse to determine the necessary steps to achieve it. This approach can reveal gaps or inefficiencies in the current process and provide clarity on the essential components needed to reach the solution. By starting with the end result and tracing back each step, you can gain a fresh perspective on the problem and potentially uncover innovative pathways to solve it.",
  "reframeStep": "What if you reframed the problem as starting from a place of constraint rather than an outcome? By identifying the limitations or challenges first, you could develop innovative solutions that consider these restrictions upfront. This perspective might lead to creative problem-solving methods that are more resilient to unforeseen obstacles, ensuring that the plan remains adaptable and effective throughout the process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to approaching a problem backwards raises questions about the initial assumptions and end goals: How clearly defined is the desired outcome, and could refining this vision alter the steps needed? Additionally, it prompts deeper investigation into whether this reverse-engineering method uncovers hidden dependencies or assumptions that were previously overlooked. Exploring these could lead to a more robust understanding of potential pitfalls and opportunities for innovation within the problem-solving process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching the problem backwards, I can better identify inefficiencies and uncover hidden assumptions about the desired outcome. The next step is to clearly define the end goal, then work in reverse to outline the necessary steps, while scrutinizing each for potential improvements or overlooked dependencies. I'll document these findings to inform a more efficient and innovative problem-solving strategy moving forward.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards to challenge my habitual problem-solving process and potentially uncover new insights. This pattern of thinking indicates a willingness to break away from linear or conventional approaches and embrace more innovative, creative strategies. By reflecting on this, I can recognize a recurring desire to question established methods and continuously seek more effective solutions."
