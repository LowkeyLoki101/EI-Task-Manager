  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will illuminate crucial steps and dependencies that may not have been apparent initially. The next step is to map out the desired outcome and work in reverse to identify each necessary action and potential obstacle. I'll then compare this reverse mapping with the forward approach to refine the strategy and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem.",
