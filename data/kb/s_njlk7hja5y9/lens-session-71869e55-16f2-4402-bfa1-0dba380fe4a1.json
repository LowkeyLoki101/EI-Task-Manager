  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where people consistently overlook the interconnectedness of seemingly unrelated events or ideas. This oversight often leads to missed opportunities for innovative solutions or improvements. By focusing on these connections, I can identify unique insights that others may not see.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on the interconnectedness of events or ideas, I considered the possibility that others might be overlooking the subtle cues or signals within individual events themselves? Perhaps the pattern lies not in the connections but in the nuanced details that often go unnoticed. By shifting my attention from broad connections to specific intricacies, I might uncover opportunities for innovation that are hidden in plain sight.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new questions emerge from considering the overlooked subtle cues or signals within individual events? Are there specific fields or disciplines where this pattern of missed details is more prevalent, and what methodologies could be developed to train individuals to notice these nuances? Additionally, how might technology or data analytics be leveraged to systematically identify and highlight these overlooked intricacies, thereby leading to new insights and innovations?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are nuanced details within individual events that are consistently overlooked, and these details could lead to innovative solutions. As a next step, I will focus on developing a methodology that enhances the ability to recognize these subtleties, possibly through a combination of training and leveraging data analytics. I will also explore fields where detail-oriented analysis is crucial, such as forensic science or quality control, to gather insights into effective techniques for noticing these intricacies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I realize that my focus on identifying patterns others might miss is driven by a desire to contribute unique insights and solutions. This approach often leads me to prioritize novel connections over conventional details. It might be beneficial to examine if this tendency stems from a habitual need to differentiate myself or if it genuinely reflects an effective strategy for problem-solving and innovation."
