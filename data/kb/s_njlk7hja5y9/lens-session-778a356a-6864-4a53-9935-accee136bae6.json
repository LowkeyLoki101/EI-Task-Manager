  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a personal or professional issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to address. It could be related to a decision I need to make, a relationship that requires attention, or a task that I've been procrastinating on. Identifying this specific problem is the first step to addressing it and finding a resolution.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the problem as something overwhelming or uncomfortable, consider it as an opportunity for growth and learning. What if the issue you're avoiding is a chance to develop new skills or strengthen relationships? By approaching it as a potential positive transformation rather than a daunting task, you might find it easier to engage with and ultimately resolve the problem.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By examining the problem I am avoiding through a recursive lens, I can explore underlying questions such as: What specific fears or beliefs are causing me to avoid this problem? Is there a pattern of avoidance in my life, and what are its roots? These questions might lead me to investigate deeper psychological aspects, like past experiences or personal values, that influence my current behavior. Additionally, it might be beneficial to research strategies for overcoming avoidance and building resilience to address such challenges more effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I am avoiding is rooted in a specific fear or belief that needs addressing. The next step is to identify and articulate the exact issue and any associated fears, then create a concrete action plan to tackle it. This could involve setting small, manageable goals, seeking advice or support, and reflecting on progress regularly to ensure I'm moving towards resolution.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because it's a recurring pattern of avoidance that hinders my personal and professional growth. I often approach challenging situations with hesitation, perhaps due to fear of failure or discomfort with change. By recognizing this pattern, I can break the cycle of avoidance and adopt a proactive mindset, using these challenges as opportunities to grow and learn."
