  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring the potential for creativity and innovation by reorganizing existing prompts or questions. By shuffling these prompts, new connections or insights might emerge that weren't apparent before, offering fresh perspectives or solutions. This approach challenges the conventional order and encourages thinking outside the box.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing the shuffling of prompts as a mere exercise in creativity, consider it as a method for uncovering hidden patterns or biases in your thinking. By rearranging prompts, you might reveal underlying assumptions or repetitive themes that shape your thought process. This reframing turns the exercise into a reflective practice, offering insights into how you structure ideas and decisions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, you might uncover new questions about the nature of creativity itself, such as how randomness influences innovation or why certain prompt combinations spark more insight than others. This process could also lead to deeper investigations into cognitive flexibility and how our brains adapt to new patterns. Additionally, exploring the impact of prompt shuffling on group brainstorming sessions could reveal insights into collaborative creativity dynamics.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can reveal new insights and foster creativity by disrupting habitual thinking patterns. As a next step, I will experiment with randomly rearranging my existing prompts and document any novel ideas or connections that emerge. This exercise will also involve reflecting on any recurring themes or biases that become apparent through this process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking to break free from habitual thought patterns and explore new ways of thinking. This approach aligns with a pattern of valuing innovation and adaptability in problem-solving. By consistently questioning and reorganizing my thought processes, I aim to unearth fresh insights and avoid stagnation in my creative endeavors."
