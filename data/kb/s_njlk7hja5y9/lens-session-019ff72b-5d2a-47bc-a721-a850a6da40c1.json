  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying and staying informed about key trends and shifts within your industry that could impact your business or career. This involves recognizing changes in technology, consumer behavior, regulatory developments, and competitive dynamics. Understanding these elements will allow you to make strategic decisions and adapt effectively.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on external industry trends, consider evaluating how your organization can proactively influence these trends. What unique innovations, solutions, or approaches can you introduce that could set new standards or shift consumer expectations? By reframing the question to \"How can I lead change within my industry?\" you position yourself not just as an observer, but as a driver of industry evolution.",

  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the question \"What's happening in my industry that I should be paying attention to?\" further, consider what specific technologies or consumer behaviors are emerging that could disrupt current business models. What are the potential ethical implications or regulatory challenges associated with these trends? Additionally, how might these trends intersect with broader global issues such as sustainability or digital transformation, and what role can your organization play in addressing these intersections? Identifying these layers can provide a comprehensive understanding of the industry's direction and your potential influence within it.",

The next step is to establish a system for continuous learning and engagement, such as subscribing to industry publications, attending relevant conferences, and participating in professional networks. Additionally, I will initiate a team workshop to brainstorm innovative approaches our organization can implement to influence these trends and lead industry change.",

This pattern of seeking external insights may indicate a reactive approach to industry changes. Consider shifting towards a more proactive mindset by not only tracking trends but also identifying ways your organization can set or influence these trends, effectively becoming a leader rather than just an observer."
