  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is identifying unexpected discoveries that challenge current assumptions or beliefs. What would truly surprise me involves uncovering information or insights that conflict with what I currently perceive as true or reasonable. This exercise requires anticipating scenarios or facts that lie outside my current expectations, prompting a reconsideration of what I assume to be certain.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different angle, consider the surprise not just as a challenge to current assumptions, but as a catalyst for new opportunities or perspectives. Instead of focusing solely on the contradictions to existing beliefs, view unexpected findings as potential gateways to innovation or personal growth. What surprising discoveries could reveal new potentials or paths you hadn't considered before, enriching your understanding or expanding your capabilities?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge such as: What underlying assumptions am I unaware of that could lead to surprising discoveries? How can I systematically explore areas where surprises are more likely to occur? This prompts deeper investigation into methodologies for uncovering hidden biases or blind spots, and strategies for fostering environments that encourage unexpected insights, such as diverse collaboration or cross-disciplinary research.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often lie in areas where I have strong, unchecked assumptions. The next step is to actively seek out and engage with diverse perspectives or disciplines that challenge my current viewpoints, potentially through collaborative projects or interdisciplinary research. This approach will help uncover surprises that could lead to innovation or personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because exploring unexpected discoveries challenges my cognitive frameworks and assumptions, fostering growth and adaptation. The pattern I'm repeating is a focus on curiosity-driven inquiry, which pushes me to question and expand my understanding of the world. By continually seeking surprises, I aim to remain open to change and innovation, using unexpected findings as a stimulus for learning and development."
