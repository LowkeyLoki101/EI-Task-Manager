  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is to explore the consequences and potential insights gained from tackling a problem in reverse order. By approaching it backwards, I can identify any overlooked starting points, assumptions, or connections that may not be apparent when addressing the problem in a conventional, forward manner. This method could potentially reveal innovative solutions or highlight underlying issues that are not immediately obvious.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on the final goal or solution, I started by examining the desired outcome and worked backwards to identify the necessary steps and conditions required to achieve it? By reframing the problem as a reverse-engineering task, I can uncover hidden dependencies and potential pitfalls, ensuring a more thorough understanding of the problem's structure and revealing alternative pathways that might not initially be considered. This perspective could lead to a more comprehensive and holistic approach, potentially simplifying complex issues by deconstructing them into manageable, interconnected parts.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By exploring the idea of approaching problems backwards, new questions arise: What types of problems are most effectively tackled using reverse engineering? How does this approach influence our cognitive biases and assumptions? This prompts deeper investigation into the methodologies and frameworks that support backward problem-solving, such as systems thinking or design thinking, and how these can be systematically applied across different disciplines to uncover innovative solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by approaching problems backwards, I can identify hidden dependencies and overlooked assumptions, leading to innovative solutions. The next step is to select a specific problem to test this approach, systematically reverse-engineering from the desired outcome to the starting point. I will document the process and outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in uncovering new insights and solutions.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this approach right now because I'm seeking innovative ways to tackle complex problems and potentially uncover insights that traditional methods might miss. The pattern I'm repeating is a willingness to challenge conventional thinking by deliberately reversing the usual problem-solving process, which can open up new avenues for exploration and understanding. This reflective habit allows me to question assumptions and explore different perspectives, ultimately enhancing my problem-solving toolkit."
