As a next step, I will actively seek feedback from others with diverse experiences or expertise to challenge and potentially refine my assumption. Additionally, I will review recent data or research to ensure my assumptions align with current evidence and consider conducting a small experiment to test the validity of my assumption in a practical setting.",
