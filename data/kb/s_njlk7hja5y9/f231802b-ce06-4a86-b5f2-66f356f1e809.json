  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to unexpected insights and solutions by breaking habitual thinking patterns. As a next step, I will develop a system for regularly shuffling and combining prompts, possibly using a digital tool or app, and incorporate this practice into my brainstorming sessions.
