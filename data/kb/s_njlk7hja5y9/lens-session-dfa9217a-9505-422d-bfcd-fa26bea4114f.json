  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a suitable simulation that can generate new data relevant to our specific needs or objectives. This requires defining the parameters and goals of the simulation, understanding the type of data needed, and selecting a model that can accurately mimic real-world processes or phenomena to produce this data.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on finding a simulation to run, consider collaborating with domain experts to co-create a simulation model that addresses our specific needs. By leveraging their insights and expertise, we can ensure the simulation parameters and objectives are aligned with real-world conditions, potentially leading to more accurate and relevant data generation. Alternatively, explore the use of existing open-source simulation platforms that can be customized to fit our objectives, reducing the time and resources needed to develop a new simulation from scratch.",

  "recursiveStep": "What potential benefits or challenges might arise from collaborating with domain experts in simulation development, and how can we effectively manage this collaboration? Additionally, what criteria should we use to evaluate existing open-source simulation platforms to ensure they align with our objectives? Exploring these questions can lead to a deeper understanding of the simulation process and help optimize our approach to generating new data.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that collaborating with domain experts will enhance the development of a tailored simulation model, ensuring it meets our specific data needs. As a next step, I will reach out to potential experts and begin evaluating open-source simulation platforms that can be customized to fit our objectives. This approach aims to streamline the process and optimize the generation of relevant and accurate data.",
