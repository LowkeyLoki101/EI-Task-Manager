  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying and questioning the assumptions that underpin my current understanding or decision-making process. I need to clearly define what these assumptions are and evaluate their validity. This involves recognizing that some of these assumptions may be based on outdated information, bias, or incomplete data, and could lead to flawed conclusions if not addressed.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially wrong assumptions, reframe the situation by considering what assumptions could be beneficial or necessary to support your decision-making. Ask yourself if there are any positive assumptions that you are overlooking which could enhance your understanding or open up new opportunities. By shifting the focus from what's wrong to what could be right, you might discover valuable insights or innovative approaches that were previously unnoticed.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the question of what assumptions might be wrong invites a deeper inquiry into the origins and impacts of these assumptions. What historical or contextual factors have shaped these assumptions, and how have they evolved over time? Additionally, consider how questioning these assumptions could influence related beliefs or decisions, potentially uncovering a network of interconnected assumptions that deserve further examination.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my assumptions are influenced by historical and contextual factors, which may not be fully relevant in the current scenario. The next step is to systematically list these assumptions, evaluate their origins and relevance, and adjust them based on current data and perspectives. I will also explore assumptions that could be beneficial, ensuring a balanced view that may lead to new opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I often find myself questioning assumptions when faced with uncertainty or doubt in decision-making. This might be part of a pattern where I default to skepticism, potentially overlooking the constructive role that some assumptions can play in moving forward. By applying a meta-lens, I can recognize this tendency and balance it with an openness to assumptions that might actually be beneficial, allowing for a more holistic approach to problem-solving."
