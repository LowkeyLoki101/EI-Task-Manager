  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a potentially significant question that has been overlooked or neglected over time. This involves reflecting on one's personal or professional life to uncover areas that might need attention or reevaluation. It's about recognizing what may have been ignored or forgotten that could offer valuable insights or lead to meaningful change.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on questions you haven't asked yourself, you considered the questions you routinely ask but from a different angle? By examining familiar questions with fresh eyes, you might uncover new insights or perspectives that were previously missed. This approach encourages a continuous cycle of introspection and growth, transforming routine inquiries into opportunities for deeper understanding and innovation.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" can lead to deeper reflections, such as: How do I determine the importance of the questions I choose to explore? What methods can I use to uncover hidden or neglected areas of my life that might benefit from inquiry? Additionally, it could be fruitful to investigate how regularly revisiting and prioritizing these overlooked questions might impact personal growth or professional development.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by routinely revisiting and prioritizing overlooked questions, I can uncover valuable insights that might lead to personal or professional growth. The next step is to set aside time each month to reflect on past concerns and explore any questions that emerge with fresh perspectives. This practice will help ensure that important areas of my life are not neglected and can lead to meaningful change.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it reflects a desire for introspection and growth, signaling a pattern of periodically reassessing my priorities and understanding. This pattern reveals my tendency to seek out overlooked areas that might hold untapped potential, suggesting I value continuous self-improvement and adaptability. By applying a meta-lens, I can recognize this recurring theme and consciously decide to either embrace or diversify my approach to self-reflection."
