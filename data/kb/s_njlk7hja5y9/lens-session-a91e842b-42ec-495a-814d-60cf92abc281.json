  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a recurring pattern that I notice but others do not, which could indicate a unique perspective or insight. This pattern might be overlooked by others due to biases, lack of information, or different priorities. Clearly defining and articulating this pattern can help in understanding its significance and potential impact.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the situation from a different perspective, consider that the pattern you keep seeing might not be missed by others, but rather interpreted differently. Perhaps your unique background, experiences, or values lead you to prioritize this pattern more than others do. This angle suggests exploring how your unique interpretation can complement or enhance the perspectives of others, potentially leading to more effective collaboration or problem-solving.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying factors or cognitive biases might cause others to overlook the pattern I see? How can I validate whether this pattern is genuinely significant or merely an artifact of my own biases? Additionally, what methods can I use to effectively communicate this pattern to others in a way that resonates with their perspectives and encourages collaborative exploration or action? These questions warrant deeper research and investigation to understand the broader context and implications of the pattern I’ve identified.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern I see is influenced by my unique experiences and perspectives, which may not be shared by others. To address this, my next step is to gather feedback from diverse individuals to test the significance of this pattern and refine my understanding. I will also develop a clear and compelling way to communicate the pattern, emphasizing its potential benefits or insights, to foster collaborative exploration and validation.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this pattern because it reflects my ongoing desire to harness unique insights that can lead to innovative solutions or improvements. This approach often repeats a pattern of valuing my distinct perspective, potentially driven by a need to contribute meaningfully or differentiate myself in collaborative settings. Recognizing this helps ensure I balance my insights with openness to others’ interpretations, fostering a more holistic understanding and collaboration."
