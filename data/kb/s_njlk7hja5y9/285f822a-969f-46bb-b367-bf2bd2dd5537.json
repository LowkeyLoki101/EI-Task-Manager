  "content": "Generated from lens processing: Given the exploration of alternative approaches and considerations, the next step is to conduct a review of existing datasets or simulations relevant to our industry to determine if they can meet our data needs. If existing data is insufficient, outline a plan to develop a custom simulation model, ensuring it incorporates necessary variables and addresses potential biases. This plan will include defining specific objectives, parameters, and validation methods to ensure the generated data is both accurate and applicable.",
