  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about the problem of procrastination and its impact on my productivity. This avoidance might be affecting my ability to meet deadlines and causing stress. Addressing this issue directly could help improve my time management and overall efficiency.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing procrastination as a problem, consider it as a signal that something deeper might be at play, such as a lack of motivation or fear of failure. From this perspective, the avoidance isn't just a barrier but an opportunity to explore underlying issues or unmet needs that, once addressed, could significantly enhance productivity and well-being. By understanding and tackling these root causes, procrastination could transform from an enemy into a guide for personal growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring procrastination further, new questions arise: What specific tasks am I procrastinating on, and why do they trigger avoidance? Is there a pattern or commonality among these tasks, such as their complexity or personal significance? Investigating these aspects can lead to deeper insights into personal motivation, fear, or resistance, prompting targeted strategies to address these underlying issues and improve productivity.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that procrastination is a signal of deeper issues, such as fear of failure or lack of motivation. My next step is to identify specific tasks I tend to procrastinate on and analyze why they trigger avoidance. By understanding these patterns, I can develop targeted strategies to address the root causes, such as setting smaller, manageable goals or seeking support to overcome fears, ultimately improving my productivity and well-being.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a pattern of avoidance in my approach to problems, specifically procrastination. This pattern may stem from a habitual discomfort with confronting issues that challenge my self-efficacy or highlight areas needing improvement. Acknowledging this pattern can help me shift my focus from avoidance to curiosity, encouraging me to explore and address the root causes of procrastination rather than just its symptoms."
