  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an unexpected discovery. This involves considering scenarios or information that contradict my current beliefs or assumptions. By exploring areas where surprises are likely, I can better prepare for or anticipate the unknown.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I shifted the perspective to consider what I might be overlooking or taking for granted in my current understanding? Instead of focusing solely on contradictions to my beliefs, I could explore areas that I haven't questioned or examined deeply enough. This shift could reveal blind spots and lead to surprising discoveries that aren't necessarily contradictory, but rather enlightening or enriching to my existing knowledge.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to \"What would surprise me if I found it?\" leads to new questions such as: What assumptions am I making about the areas I haven't deeply examined? Are there interconnected fields or perspectives that might bring unexpected insights when combined with my current knowledge? This exploration could involve deeper research into interdisciplinary approaches or emerging fields that challenge or expand my existing framework, potentially revealing surprising connections or innovations.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprising discoveries are more likely to emerge from areas I haven't deeply examined or from interdisciplinary approaches that connect seemingly unrelated fields. As a next step, I will identify specific domains or fields outside my usual focus and conduct exploratory research or engage with experts in those areas to uncover potential surprises or insights that could enrich my current understanding.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now to challenge and expand my current understanding, seeking to uncover hidden assumptions or overlooked areas that could lead to unexpected insights. This pattern of introspection reflects a broader approach of continuous learning and curiosity, where I actively seek to identify and question what I take for granted. By doing so, I aim to cultivate a mindset that is open to discovery and adaptable to new information."
