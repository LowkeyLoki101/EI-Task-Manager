  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a unique and surprising pattern in solar technology that has been overlooked by others. This involves exploring emerging trends, anomalies, or unexpected applications in solar energy that can serve as the foundation for a compelling story. The key is to pinpoint an angle that is both novel and impactful, captivating audiences with insights they haven't considered before.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on technological advancements or patterns within the industry, consider reframing the exploration to include the human and environmental stories behind solar technology. What if you examined the unexpected ways solar technology is transforming communities in remote areas or how indigenous knowledge is integrating with solar innovations? This shift in perspective might reveal a narrative that not only highlights surprising patterns but also resonates deeply on a social and cultural level.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the untold stories of individuals or communities who have creatively adapted solar technology to their unique cultural or environmental contexts? How might these adaptations reveal broader patterns of resilience and innovation in sustainable living? Additionally, what unexpected partnerships or collaborations are emerging between traditional knowledge holders and solar tech innovators, and how do these relationships redefine the future of sustainable energy solutions? These questions warrant deeper investigation to uncover novel insights and narratives.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the exploration, my working hypothesis is that a compelling story hook lies in the intersection of solar technology with indigenous knowledge and remote community applications. The next step is to research and gather stories of communities that have uniquely integrated solar technology, highlighting both the human impact and innovative collaborations. This approach will involve reaching out to organizations working in these areas and reviewing case studies to uncover these untold narratives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back, it's clear that the motivation for seeking a unique story hook in solar technology stems from a desire to uncover overlooked narratives that challenge conventional thinking. This approach reflects a pattern of valuing innovation and differentiation in storytelling. Recognizing this, it's important to continually question assumptions and explore interdisciplinary connections, ensuring the narrative not only surprises but also offers meaningful insights that can drive broader impact."
