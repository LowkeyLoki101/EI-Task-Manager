  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a pattern where certain repetitive behaviors or trends continue to occur, but they go unnoticed by others because they might be too focused on the immediate details or outcomes. This could be in the form of overlooked inefficiencies in processes, recurring mistakes, or emerging trends that others have not yet identified. Stating it clearly, I notice these patterns because I take a step back to look at the bigger picture, which might help in anticipating future issues or opportunities.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern I keep seeing isn't just about overlooked inefficiencies or recurring mistakes, but rather a deeper indication of underlying systemic issues or cultural dynamics within the organization? By shifting my focus from individual behaviors to organizational structures, I might discover that these patterns are symptoms of larger challenges, such as a lack of communication, insufficient training, or misaligned incentives, which could lead to more strategic interventions. This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing root causes rather than merely managing symptoms.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, I should consider what deeper systemic or cultural dynamics are perpetuating these patterns and why they remain unnoticed by others. Are there specific organizational blind spots or biases at play? Additionally, I should explore whether these patterns exist in similar contexts outside my immediate environment, which could provide a broader understanding of their origins and potential solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the patterns I observe are indicative of deeper systemic issues within the organization, possibly stemming from communication gaps, insufficient training, or misaligned incentives. As a next step, I will conduct a thorough analysis of these patterns by gathering data and feedback from various departments to identify common themes and root causes. This will help in formulating strategic interventions aimed at addressing these foundational challenges.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this right now because I have a tendency to notice patterns that others might overlook, which could be due to my inclination towards strategic thinking and problem-solving. This pattern of stepping back and analyzing from a broader perspective may repeat because I often seek to understand the root causes of issues rather than just addressing surface-level symptoms. By applying this approach consistently, I aim to uncover deeper insights that can drive more effective and sustainable solutions."
