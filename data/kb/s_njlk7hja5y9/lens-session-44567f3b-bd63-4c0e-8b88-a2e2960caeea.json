  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a significant question that I haven't revisited recently, which could provide new insights or prompt personal growth. I see the need to explore areas of my life or thinking patterns that I've neglected or assumed were resolved. This involves reflecting on past queries that sparked curiosity or change but have since been left unexamined.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a specific question that hasn't been asked in a while, consider reframing the approach to identify areas of life that are currently unchanged or stagnant. What if you approached this as an opportunity to explore areas where growth seems slow or where curiosity has waned? This shift in perspective could uncover broader themes or patterns that require attention, rather than seeking a single question.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens brings up questions about the underlying reasons for forgetting or neglecting certain queries in the first place. What patterns in my life or mindset lead to overlooking these areas? It also prompts an investigation into how regularly revisiting past questions could foster ongoing growth and adaptability, and whether there are specific tools or practices that can help keep these important questions at the forefront of my reflection process.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I need to establish a regular practice of reflection to identify neglected areas of my life that could benefit from renewed inquiry. As a next step, I will set aside time each week to review past journal entries or personal reflections to uncover recurring themes or questions that have gone unaddressed. This practice should help maintain a dynamic and evolving personal growth journey.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it's important to ensure continuous personal growth and prevent stagnation in my thought patterns. I might be repeating a pattern of seeking clarity or novelty only when prompted by discomfort or change, rather than as a regular practice. This reflection can help me establish a more proactive approach to self-inquiry and growth."
