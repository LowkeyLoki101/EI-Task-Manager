  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem-solving challenge where traditional methods may not be yielding the desired results, prompting an exploration of reverse engineering. By approaching the problem backwards, I would start from the desired outcome and work in reverse to identify the steps needed to achieve it. This could reveal overlooked aspects or assumptions in the forward approach, allowing for a fresh perspective and potentially more effective solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "From a completely different perspective, consider the problem as if it were a puzzle with missing pieces rather than a linear process. Instead of focusing solely on the endpoint and working backward, examine each component independently to see how they fit together in various orders. This might reveal alternative pathways or combinations that aren't apparent when strictly adhering to a backward or forward direction.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, one might ask: How could this backward approach be applied to other areas or problems beyond the current scope? What systems or processes inherently work better when reverse-engineered? Additionally, it would be worth investigating if there are patterns or principles that consistently emerge when problems are solved in reverse, and how these insights could be generalized or applied to improve problem-solving strategies in various fields.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by reverse-engineering the problem, I can uncover hidden dependencies or assumptions that were missed in the forward approach. The next step will be to outline the desired outcome and systematically trace back the steps needed to achieve it, identifying any alternative pathways or critical factors that come to light. I will then apply these insights to test whether they improve the efficiency or effectiveness of my problem-solving strategy.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about approaching the problem backwards arises from a desire to break free from conventional, possibly ineffective methods. This pattern of seeking alternative approaches suggests a tendency to challenge assumptions and explore non-linear solutions. By using this meta-lens, I aim to cultivate a mindset that values flexibility and creativity in problem-solving, recognizing that innovative insights often emerge from questioning traditional strategies."
