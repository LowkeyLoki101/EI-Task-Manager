  "trigger": "What's happening in my industry that I should be paying attention to?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying the key trends and changes occurring within your industry that could impact your business. This includes technological advancements, shifts in consumer behavior, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics. Understanding these elements is essential to strategically position your business for future growth and innovation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying external industry trends, consider analyzing your own company's internal data and customer feedback to anticipate changes and innovations. This perspective shifts the emphasis from reacting to industry trends to proactively understanding and predicting what your customers and operations indicate about future needs and opportunities. By reframing the trigger in this way, you position yourself to drive industry trends rather than simply follow them.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider what underlying factors are driving the current trends in your industry. Are there emerging technologies or societal shifts that might not be immediately apparent but could have long-term implications? Additionally, investigate how these trends interact with each other and what new questions arise about your business model's adaptability and resilience in response to these changes. What further research could uncover hidden opportunities or threats stemming from these interactions?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by combining industry trend analysis with internal data insights, I can better anticipate and shape future developments, turning potential challenges into opportunities. As a next step, I will conduct a thorough review of both external industry reports and internal customer feedback to identify key patterns and gaps. Additionally, I will initiate a cross-departmental meeting to discuss how current operations align with these trends and explore innovative strategies to leverage them.",

The pattern you may be repeating is focusing predominantly on external factors and industry benchmarks rather than leveraging internal insights and innovations. Recognizing this can shift your approach towards a more balanced strategy that integrates both external trends and internal capabilities to drive sustainable growth."
