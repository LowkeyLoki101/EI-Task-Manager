  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is the need to identify a significant question that has been overlooked or neglected recently. This involves introspection to uncover areas of personal or professional life that may need attention, growth, or reevaluation. The focus is on bringing to light a question that could lead to meaningful insights or changes.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this, consider approaching it from the perspective of others. What question would someone close to you, like a mentor or close friend, suggest you haven't asked yourself recently? This shifts the introspection to an external viewpoint, potentially unveiling blind spots by considering how others perceive your growth and challenges. Additionally, think about a completely different area of life, such as physical health or creative pursuits, that hasn't been the focus lately, and identify a question that could spark new insights or actions in that domain.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring this question recursively, consider what underlying assumptions or beliefs might have prevented you from asking certain questions. What are the potential consequences of not addressing these overlooked areas? Furthermore, how might regularly revisiting this introspective practice impact your long-term personal growth or decision-making processes? Investigating these angles could lead to a deeper understanding of the barriers to introspection and the benefits of maintaining a routine of self-questioning.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that regularly asking myself, \"What aspect of my life have I been neglecting that could significantly benefit from my attention?\" could lead to valuable insights and growth. As a next step, I will set aside a dedicated time each month to reflect on different areas of my life, such as relationships, career, health, and personal development, to identify any overlooked questions and address them proactively. This routine will help ensure a balanced focus and prevent stagnation in any particular area.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there's a recurring pattern of neglecting certain areas of introspection, possibly due to routine or comfort zones. This pattern suggests a need to periodically step back and reassess where attention hasn't been focused, ensuring a holistic view of personal growth. By applying a meta-lens, I'm aiming to break out of habitual thinking and explore areas that may have been unconsciously sidelined."
