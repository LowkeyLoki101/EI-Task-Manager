  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to identify and develop a compelling story hook that centers on an unexpected pattern in solar technology, which has not been widely recognized or discussed. This involves uncovering a unique aspect or trend within solar tech advancements, adoption, or impact that defies common narratives, creating an opportunity for fresh storytelling. The goal is to pinpoint this overlooked pattern and leverage it to engage and inform an audience in a novel way.",
  "reframeStep": "Consider reframing the story hook from the perspective of consumer behavior and societal impact rather than focusing solely on technological advancements. Explore how the integration of solar technology is creating unexpected shifts in communities or altering traditional energy consumption patterns. Alternatively, examine the environmental or economic ripple effects in regions that are adopting solar technology in unconventional ways, potentially revealing a narrative about grassroots innovation or resilience in the face of climate challenges.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the underlying reasons for the unconventional adoption of solar technology in certain regions, and how do these dynamics differ from typical adoption patterns? Additionally, how is solar technology influencing cultural or social changes, potentially leading to new narratives about community empowerment or shifts in economic power structures? Investigating these questions could reveal deeper insights into the societal transformation driven by solar technology, offering rich material for a compelling story hook.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unconventional adoption of solar technology in specific regions is leading to unexpected cultural and social changes, such as community empowerment and shifts in economic power structures. The next step is to conduct interviews with stakeholders in these regions, including community leaders and local businesses, to gather firsthand accounts and data that illustrate these shifts. This will help develop a compelling narrative that highlights the broader societal impact of solar technology beyond its environmental benefits.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because there's a drive to uncover fresh narratives that challenge the status quo in solar technology storytelling, which may be crucial in engaging audiences who are fatigued by conventional discussions. This approach might reflect a pattern in my methodology where I consistently seek to innovate by questioning existing perspectives and looking for intersections between technology and societal impacts that are not immediately apparent."
