  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that I would be genuinely surprised to discover evidence that fundamentally contradicts my deeply held beliefs or assumptions about a particular topic, such as human behavior or technological possibilities. As a next step, I will actively seek out perspectives and research that challenge my current views, keeping an open mind to identify and reflect on any unexpected findings that arise. This approach will help me uncover potential blind spots and deepen my understanding.",
