  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is determining an engaging and relevant story hook for marketing content that resonates with the target audience today. This requires identifying current trends, audience interests, and potential emotional or rational appeals that can capture attention effectively. The goal is to craft a narrative that not only attracts but also retains the audience's interest and compels them to take action.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of focusing on finding a new story hook, you considered revisiting and revitalizing a previous successful campaign with a fresh angle or update that aligns with current events or trends? By leveraging the familiarity and proven impact of a past narrative, you could create a sense of nostalgia while infusing it with contemporary relevance. This approach not only saves time but also builds on established audience connections and perceived brand consistency.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider exploring questions such as: What are the current cultural or social movements that could influence the story hook? How can emerging technologies like AI or virtual reality be integrated into the narrative to enhance engagement? Additionally, investigate how global events or shifts in consumer behavior might provide new angles for storytelling that resonate with today's audience. This deeper exploration can uncover innovative and timely story hooks that are both relevant and impactful.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to leverage a previously successful campaign by updating it with elements from current cultural trends, such as sustainability or digital innovation, to craft a story hook that resonates with today's audience. The next step is to analyze past campaigns for successful elements and align them with current events or technologies, ensuring the narrative feels both familiar and fresh. This approach will not only save resources but also strengthen brand continuity and relevance.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm considering why I'm seeking a story hook now and noticing a pattern of always looking for fresh ideas instead of maximizing existing successful strategies. This approach indicates a tendency to overlook the value of historical data and proven methods in favor of novelty, which may not always be necessary or beneficial. By recognizing this pattern, I can balance innovation with optimization of past successes."
