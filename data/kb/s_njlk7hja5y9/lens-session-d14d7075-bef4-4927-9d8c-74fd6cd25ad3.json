  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a meaningful question that has been neglected or overlooked in recent times. This involves introspection to uncover areas of personal or professional life where curiosity or self-inquiry may have been absent. The goal is to pinpoint a question that, once considered, could lead to valuable insights or growth.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the question from a different angle, consider: \"What assumptions have I been operating under without question?\" Instead of focusing solely on identifying missed questions, this approach challenges you to examine the beliefs or routines that you take for granted. By questioning these underlying assumptions, you may reveal new areas of inquiry or insight that have been neglected due to familiarity or complacency.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" prompts further inquiry into the nature of the questions themselves. What criteria do you use to determine the importance or relevance of questions in your life? How do different life stages or experiences influence the types of questions you ask? This exploration can lead to deeper research into how personal growth or shifts in perspective affect the questions that guide your thinking and decision-making processes.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by examining the assumptions I've been operating under without question, I can uncover areas ripe for new inquiry and growth. The next step is to set aside time for reflective journaling, focusing on identifying and questioning those underlying assumptions. This practice will help me uncover neglected questions and guide my personal and professional development moving forward.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" right now suggests a desire for introspection and self-awareness, possibly to break out of routine thinking patterns. This reflects a pattern of seeking growth through introspection and challenging the status quo. By consciously recognizing this pattern, you can strategically use it to not only revisit forgotten inquiries but also to regularly reassess assumptions and stimulate ongoing personal development."
