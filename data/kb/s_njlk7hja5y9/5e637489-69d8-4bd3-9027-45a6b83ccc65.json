  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the question I haven't asked myself in a while likely involves assumptions about my relationships or unexplored areas of knowledge. The next step is to actively seek feedback from friends or colleagues about my interactions with them, and to intentionally explore a new subject that I've been hesitant to approach.
