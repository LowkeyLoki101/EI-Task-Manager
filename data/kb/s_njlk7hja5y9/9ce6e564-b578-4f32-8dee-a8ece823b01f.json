  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by engaging with new experiences and perspectives, I will naturally uncover important questions that I've neglected. The next step is to actively seek out activities or discussions that push me outside my comfort zone, such as joining a new group, trying a different hobby, or having a deep conversation with someone whose views differ from mine. This approach will likely stimulate fresh insights and highlight areas of my life that need reevaluation.",
