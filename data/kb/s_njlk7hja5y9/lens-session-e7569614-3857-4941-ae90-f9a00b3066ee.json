  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "I see a need for introspection and self-awareness. The problem is identifying what important areas of my life or aspects of my self-understanding have been neglected or overlooked. This involves examining whether there are personal or professional questions that I have avoided or simply forgotten to consider, which could be crucial for growth or decision-making.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the questions you haven't asked, consider reframing your perspective to identify the questions you are consistently asking yourself and why. This might reveal patterns or biases in your thinking that could be limiting your growth. Additionally, think about the external influences or situations that have shaped your current line of questioning, and explore how changing your environment or seeking new experiences could naturally prompt new, unasked questions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying assumptions have led to these neglected questions, and how might they be influencing my current thinking patterns? Are there specific areas of my life—such as relationships, career goals, or personal interests—that I haven't thoroughly examined recently, and what new perspectives or information could I seek out to explore these areas more fully? Additionally, how could regularly engaging in diverse activities or discussions help in naturally surfacing these overlooked questions?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that I may have overlooked certain aspects of my personal or professional life due to recurring thought patterns and environmental influences. As a next step, I'll set aside dedicated time each week for reflective journaling, focusing on areas I haven't explored recently, such as personal relationships and long-term career ambitions. Additionally, I'll seek out new experiences or engage in conversations with diverse individuals to naturally surface fresh questions and perspectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I recognize that I'm currently engaging in a pattern of seeking deeper self-awareness and personal growth. This approach often stems from a desire to ensure I'm not missing out on potential insights or areas for improvement. However, this pattern also suggests a tendency to overemphasize introspection, possibly at the expense of taking action or embracing spontaneity. Acknowledging this, I should consider balancing introspective questioning with periods of action and experimentation to foster a more dynamic approach to personal development."
