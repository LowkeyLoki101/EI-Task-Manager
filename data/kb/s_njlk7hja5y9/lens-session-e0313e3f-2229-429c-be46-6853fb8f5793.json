  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of my current assumptions. The core issue is identifying which assumptions underpin my thinking and determining if any of them are flawed or unfounded. This requires a clear examination of my beliefs and the evidence supporting them to ensure I'm not operating based on incorrect or outdated information.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially flawed assumptions, consider the perspective of embracing uncertainty and being open to new information. View this as an opportunity to explore unknown areas and learn, rather than merely correcting mistakes. Shifting to a mindset that values adaptability and continuous learning might reveal innovative solutions and foster personal growth.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential sources of these assumptions, and how do they influence my decision-making process? Could there be other areas in my life or work where similar assumptions are being made, and how might they affect outcomes? Investigating these questions can lead to a deeper understanding of the systemic nature of assumptions and highlight areas for further research or reflection, such as the impact of cognitive biases or the role of diverse perspectives in challenging entrenched beliefs.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or limited perspectives. The next step will be to actively seek diverse viewpoints and feedback from others to challenge and expand my understanding. I will also make it a point to regularly review and question my assumptions, treating them as hypotheses to be tested rather than fixed beliefs.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about potential flawed assumptions because I want to ensure my decisions and beliefs are based on accurate information. This reflects a pattern of seeking certainty and control in my understanding of situations. By consistently questioning assumptions, I aim to avoid errors, but it may also indicate a tendency towards over-caution and a reluctance to embrace uncertainty, which could limit my openness to new ideas and adaptability."
