  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying a meaningful or impactful question that I haven't considered recently, which could lead to personal growth or a shift in perspective. This involves reflecting on areas of my life or thinking patterns that might have been neglected or assumed to be settled. By framing this, I see the opportunity to uncover blind spots or outdated assumptions that may benefit from reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question I've overlooked, what if I approached this by considering what areas of my life have become too routine or automatic? By examining the parts of my daily life that I take for granted or no longer consciously think about, I might uncover new questions that challenge my current assumptions and open pathways for growth. This shift from question-based reflection to routine scrutiny could reveal hidden opportunities for personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the recursive lens, new questions that emerge include: What specific areas of my life have become so routine that they no longer require conscious thought, and why have they become that way? Are there underlying assumptions or beliefs driving these routines that I should question? These inquiries prompt a deeper investigation into the reasons behind my routines and whether they truly serve my current goals and values, potentially leading to transformative shifts in how I approach daily life.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that examining areas of my life that have become routine can reveal overlooked questions and assumptions. As a next step, I'll identify one routine task this week and consciously reflect on the underlying assumptions and beliefs driving it. This will help me uncover any necessary adjustments or new questions that can contribute to personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it challenges my tendency to stick with familiar thought patterns and routines, which can lead to stagnation. This reflects a pattern of seeking growth through introspection, but often getting stuck in familiar loops. By examining my habits and routines with a meta-lens, I can identify areas where I might be overlooking opportunities for deeper inquiry and change, thus breaking the cycle and fostering more dynamic personal growth."
