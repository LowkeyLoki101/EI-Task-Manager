The next step is to identify exactly what this problem is by reflecting on recent situations that cause me discomfort or anxiety. I will set aside time to journal about these feelings and past experiences, aiming to uncover patterns or triggers, and then outline a plan to address the issue incrementally, focusing on manageable actions that build my confidence and resilience.",
