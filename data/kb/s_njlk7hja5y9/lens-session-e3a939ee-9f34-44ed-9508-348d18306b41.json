  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see an opportunity to reverse-engineer the problem-solving process by starting with the end goal and tracing steps back to the present situation. This approach can reveal overlooked assumptions and dependencies, potentially uncovering new insights or alternative solutions. By identifying the desired outcome first, I can establish a clearer path of necessary actions or changes needed to reach that outcome.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the end goal, what if I reframe the problem by considering the initial conditions and constraints that led to the current situation? By understanding the origins and context of the problem, I might uncover foundational issues or root causes that need addressing. This could lead to solutions that not only solve the current problem but also prevent similar issues in the future.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, we can explore questions such as: How did similar problems evolve over time, and what patterns can be discerned from their resolution paths? What are the potential implications of solving the current problem backwards for future problem-solving strategies in similar contexts? Additionally, further research could investigate historical case studies where reverse engineering led to innovative solutions, revealing insights into how this approach can be effectively implemented in various fields.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards could uncover hidden dependencies and assumptions that might not be evident when moving forward. As a next step, I will outline the desired outcome and systematically identify each preceding step required to achieve it. This reverse mapping will guide the identification of potential gaps or overlooked factors that need addressing.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because it challenges my usual problem-solving pattern, which typically focuses on a linear progression from start to finish. This approach allows me to break away from habitual thinking and potentially uncover insights by examining the problem from a different angle. By questioning my current methods and exploring alternative strategies, I'm fostering a mindset that values adaptability and innovation."
