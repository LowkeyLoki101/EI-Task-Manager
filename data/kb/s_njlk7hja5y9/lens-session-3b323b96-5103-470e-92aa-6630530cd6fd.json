  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand involves considering the potential outcomes of approaching a problem in reverse order. By framing this, I see a situation where the typical process or sequence of solving a problem is inverted, starting from the desired outcome and working backward to the initial conditions. The goal is to uncover insights or solutions that might not be apparent when following a conventional forward-thinking approach, potentially revealing new strategies or perspectives that could simplify or enhance the solution process.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem from a different angle, consider what insights could be gained by involving a diverse team to approach the problem backwards. Instead of relying solely on your perspective, gather input from individuals with varying expertise or experiences who might identify different starting points or assumptions. This collaborative reverse-engineering approach could reveal overlooked connections or innovative solutions by leveraging the collective knowledge and unique viewpoints of the group.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Approaching the problem backwards raises new questions about the assumptions we make when defining the 'desired outcome.' How might redefining this outcome shift our approach entirely? Additionally, investigating the steps or processes that are typically taken for granted in forward-thinking could uncover hidden dependencies or constraints. Delving deeper into these areas could reveal untapped opportunities for innovation or simplification.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching the problem backwards will reveal alternative pathways and assumptions that are not immediately obvious in a forward-thinking process. The next step is to assemble a diverse team to collaboratively reverse-engineer the problem, starting from a clearly defined desired outcome. This action will help identify any hidden dependencies or innovative solutions that may streamline the solution process or open new avenues for exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By applying a meta-lens, I'm thinking about this problem backwards to challenge the conventional linear approach and open up new pathways for creativity and problem-solving. This pattern of reversing the sequence is something I utilize to break free from habitual thinking, allowing me to explore alternative strategies that might not be evident in a typical forward analysis. It's a deliberate practice aimed at fostering innovation and uncovering hidden insights."
