  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for marketing content that will engage the target audience effectively. I see the need to capture attention quickly by tapping into current trends, emotions, or relatable experiences that resonate with the audience's needs and values. The focus should be on creating a narrative that not only informs but also inspires and connects on a personal level.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the challenge of finding a compelling story hook by considering what unexpected or unconventional angles could be explored. Instead of focusing solely on the audience's needs and values, think about what aspect of your brand or product could surprise or delight them. Consider leveraging an unknown fact, a counterintuitive insight, or a behind-the-scenes perspective that might intrigue the audience and lead to a deeper engagement with the content.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this exploration, consider which specific current trends or societal issues could be further examined to enhance the story hook. What are emerging consumer expectations or behaviors that might be leveraged? Additionally, explore the emotional triggers that are currently resonating most with audiences, and how these can be woven into the narrative. Finally, investigate the potential for incorporating multimedia elements that could amplify the impact of the story, such as interactive content, videos, or user-generated stories.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to create a story hook that leverages an unexpected angle about a current societal trend—such as sustainability or digital transformation—by highlighting an unknown fact or a behind-the-scenes perspective of the brand. The next step is to brainstorm specific angles and test them with a small audience segment to gauge engagement and refine the narrative. Additionally, incorporate multimedia elements like short videos or interactive polls to enhance audience interaction and interest.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because creating engaging marketing content is crucial for capturing and maintaining audience interest, which is vital for brand success and growth. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing too much on conventional approaches and audience expectations, rather than exploring creative or unexpected angles that could differentiate the content and make it more memorable."
