  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the pattern I am noticing may be overlooked by others due to cognitive biases or a lack of awareness and access to specific data. The next step is to design a presentation or report that effectively communicates this pattern, highlighting its significance and potential impact. I will also seek feedback from colleagues to refine my approach and ensure that it resonates with and is accessible to a broader audience.",
