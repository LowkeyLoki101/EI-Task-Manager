  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "By shuffling my own prompts, I can discover new combinations and perspectives that may lead to fresh insights or ideas. This process will allow me to break out of established patterns and potentially uncover innovative questions or topics I hadn't considered before. The goal is to explore the creativity that emerges from the random juxtaposition of existing prompts.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the creativity that emerges from shuffling prompts, consider the process as a way to challenge cognitive biases and assumptions. By rearranging prompts, you might not only generate new ideas but also question the underlying assumptions of each prompt, leading to deeper insights about your thought processes. This approach transforms shuffling into a tool for introspection and critical analysis, beyond just creativity.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "When considering the act of shuffling prompts, new questions emerge such as: How does the randomness of shuffling affect the quality and relevance of the generated prompts? What patterns or themes consistently arise despite the shuffling? These questions deserve deeper investigation, including researching the impact of randomness on creativity and exploring methods to analyze recurring themes that may point to underlying cognitive biases or persistent areas of interest.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling my prompts will reveal new combinations that challenge my cognitive biases and assumptions, leading to both creative insights and deeper introspection. The next step is to systematically shuffle and document the prompts, then analyze the results for recurring themes and unexpected pairings. I'll follow this with a review to identify insights about my thought processes and potential areas for further exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I seek to break free from routine thought patterns and explore new perspectives. This reflects a recurring pattern of using randomness as a tool to disrupt conventional thinking and challenge my assumptions. By recognizing this tendency, I can more consciously harness it to not only generate creative ideas but also to critically evaluate and refine my thought processes."
