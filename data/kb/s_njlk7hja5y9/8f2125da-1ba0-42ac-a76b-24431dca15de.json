  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to pursue a collaboration with data science experts or academic institutions to design a bespoke simulation model tailored to our specific objectives. As a next step, I'll reach out to potential partners and initiate discussions to explore collaborative opportunities. Additionally, I'll define the key variables and intended outcomes to guide the development and validation of the simulation model.",
