  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying an engaging and relevant story hook for today's marketing content. The goal is to capture the audience's attention with a narrative that resonates with current trends or issues. It's essential to consider the target audience's interests, the brand's message, and the context of today's societal or industry landscape.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on current trends or issues, consider reframing the story hook by tapping into timeless, universal themes such as human connection, resilience, or innovation. This perspective shifts the emphasis from a fleeting trend to a narrative that can resonate across different demographics and time periods, potentially broadening the appeal and longevity of the marketing content. Additionally, you could explore the story from the perspective of your audience's future aspirations, creating content that aligns with their goals and dreams, thereby fostering a deeper emotional connection.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the exploration of timeless themes and audience aspirations, new questions arise: How can we effectively integrate storytelling techniques that highlight universal themes while staying authentic to the brand's voice? What research is needed to identify specific aspirations and dreams of our target audience? Additionally, how might emerging technologies like AI or augmented reality enhance the storytelling experience, making it more immersive and personalized? These questions warrant deeper investigation to craft a compelling and innovative marketing narrative.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a marketing story hook that combines a universal theme, such as resilience or innovation, with an aspirational aspect that resonates with the target audience's future goals. The next step is to conduct audience research to identify these specific aspirations and dreams. Additionally, I will explore how emerging technologies, like AI or augmented reality, can be utilized to create a more engaging and personalized storytelling experience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because creating compelling marketing content is crucial for engaging audiences in a competitive market. The pattern I'm repeating is focusing on finding a quick, trend-based solution rather than exploring deeper, more enduring narratives. This pattern might limit the potential for creating content that connects on a more profound level and remains relevant over time."
