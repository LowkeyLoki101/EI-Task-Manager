  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an engaging story hook for marketing content that resonates with today's audience. I see the need to capture attention quickly and connect emotionally with the target audience. The goal is to find a unique angle or narrative that aligns with current trends and the brand's message, creating a compelling reason for the audience to engage with the content.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what story hook to use for marketing content, consider what unique insights or experiences your target audience is currently engaging with. Reframe the question to explore how your brand or product can become a part of their ongoing narrative, perhaps by tapping into current societal shifts or trending topics that resonate emotionally with your audience. Additionally, consider how your story can offer a fresh perspective or solution to a challenge they are facing today, thereby positioning your content as both relevant and valuable.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "To delve deeper into finding an engaging story hook, consider asking: What are the current societal values or emotions that are gaining attention, and how can they be authentically woven into the brand's narrative? Additionally, explore which storytelling formats or platforms are currently most effective at capturing audience interest, and how they can be leveraged to enhance the impact of your story. Investigating these areas could reveal new opportunities for deeper audience connection and engagement.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a compelling story hook should integrate current societal values and trending topics with the brand's message, while also addressing an emotional or practical need of the target audience. The next step is to conduct research on trending societal issues and popular content formats, then brainstorm how these elements can be authentically combined with the brand's narrative to create relevant and engaging marketing content. This will involve monitoring social media platforms and industry reports to gather insights and testing different story hooks to evaluate audience engagement.",
