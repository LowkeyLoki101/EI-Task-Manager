  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves questioning the assumption that AI will always have a positive impact on the energy sector by improving efficiency and reducing costs. By considering the reverse, we might explore scenarios where AI could lead to increased energy consumption due to processing power demands or potential job displacement issues. This examination can reveal a more balanced view of AI's role, prompting more comprehensive planning and policy-making.",
  "reframeStep": "From a completely different perspective, consider the scenario where AI is not just a tool for efficiency but also a catalyst for innovation in the energy sector. Instead of focusing solely on efficiency gains, what if AI drives the creation of entirely new energy sources or methods of distribution that are more sustainable and less reliant on traditional infrastructures? This perspective shifts the focus from incremental improvements to transformative changes that could redefine energy production and consumption, prompting stakeholders to explore and invest in groundbreaking research and development opportunities.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive dimension, we might ask: What are the long-term societal and environmental impacts if AI in the energy sector drives disruptive innovation rather than incremental efficiency improvements? Additionally, how might regulatory frameworks need to evolve to address both potential benefits and unforeseen consequences of AI-driven energy innovations? These questions warrant deeper investigation into the intersection of AI, policy-making, and sustainability to ensure balanced development in the energy sector.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI has the potential to drive both efficiency and innovation in the energy sector, we must also consider and prepare for possible negative outcomes such as increased energy consumption or job displacement. The next step involves conducting a detailed analysis of specific AI applications in energy to identify both positive and negative impacts. This analysis will inform more balanced and forward-thinking policies and investments in AI-driven energy innovations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there's a prevalent narrative that AI will inherently benefit the energy sector by enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. By examining this assumption, I'm repeating a pattern of critically evaluating dominant narratives to uncover potential blind spots or overlooked opportunities. This approach can lead to more holistic strategies that consider both positive and negative outcomes, fostering innovation and resilience in planning."
