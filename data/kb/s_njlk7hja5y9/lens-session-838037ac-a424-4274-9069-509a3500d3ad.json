  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that AI will predominantly have a positive impact on the energy sector by optimizing processes and increasing efficiency. If I consider the reverse, I need to explore the potential negative impacts, such as job displacement, increased energy consumption due to AI operations, and the risk of over-reliance on AI systems which could lead to vulnerabilities. This perspective would require assessing the balance between AI's benefits and potential drawbacks, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of its role in the energy sector.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on AI's impact on efficiency and optimization as positive, consider reframing the assumption to view AI as a disruptive force challenging the current norms and practices in the energy sector. This perspective shifts the focus to how AI might drive a paradigm shift, prompting the sector to innovate in ways that are not just about efficiency gains but also about transforming business models and energy systems. By looking at AI as a catalyst for change rather than just an optimizer, we can explore new opportunities and threats that arise from fundamentally altering how energy is produced, managed, and consumed.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From considering AI as a potentially disruptive force in the energy sector, new questions emerge about specific areas of disruption: How might AI influence regulatory policies, and what are the implications for energy markets and pricing? Additionally, what are the potential environmental impacts of AI-driven energy innovations, both positive and negative? These questions deserve deeper research to understand the broader socio-economic and environmental consequences of AI integration in the energy sector.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI presents significant opportunities for efficiency and innovation in the energy sector, it also poses challenges that need careful consideration, such as regulatory changes and environmental impacts. The next step is to conduct a detailed analysis of these potential disruptions and develop strategies to mitigate risks while maximizing benefits. This involves engaging with stakeholders across the sector to gather diverse perspectives and ensure a balanced approach to AI integration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By stepping back with a meta-lens, I'm currently examining my thought process to identify repetitive patterns in my assumptions about technological impacts, particularly focusing on positive outcomes. This reflection reveals a tendency to initially emphasize benefits, potentially overlooking risks or disruptions. Recognizing this pattern prompts me to adopt a more balanced view, ensuring I evaluate both positive and negative aspects of AI's role in the energy sector."
