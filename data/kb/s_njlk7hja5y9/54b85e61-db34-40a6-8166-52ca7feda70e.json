  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can reveal unconscious patterns and stimulate new creative pathways, both individually and collectively. The next step is to conduct a practical experiment by shuffling a set of my existing prompts and observing the new ideas or themes that emerge.
