This involves staying informed about emerging technologies, regulatory shifts, and market dynamics that could influence your strategic decisions. The goal is to pinpoint relevant developments that require your attention and could offer opportunities or pose challenges.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying trends, consider reframing the question to explore how you can actively shape or influence those trends within your industry. By looking at it from the perspective of an innovator or thought leader, you shift from a reactive to a proactive stance, potentially driving change rather than just adapting to it. This perspective encourages you to think about how your unique insights and capabilities can contribute to the evolution of your industry.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about what's happening in your industry right now, you're likely aiming to stay competitive and informed, ensuring you don't fall behind on critical developments. This pattern of thinking may reflect a habitual approach of responding to industry changes rather than anticipating them. Consider whether this approach inadvertently limits your potential to lead innovation, and explore how you can integrate a more forward-looking strategy that not only monitors trends but also predicts and sets them."
