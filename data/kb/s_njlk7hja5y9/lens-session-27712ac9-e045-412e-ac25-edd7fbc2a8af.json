  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is determining a compelling story hook for today's marketing content. I see the need to identify a narrative or theme that will resonate with the target audience and effectively capture their attention. It's crucial to align this story hook with current trends, audience interests, and the core message of the brand or product.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing the problem, consider a story hook from the perspective of the audience's journey rather than the brand's message. What if you focused on a story that highlights how the product or service transforms the customer's life, showcasing a before-and-after scenario? This angle allows you to create content that is more relatable and emotionally engaging, directly addressing the audience's aspirations and challenges.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the audience's journey perspective, further questions arise: What specific challenges or aspirations does the target audience face that the product or service can address? How can customer testimonials or case studies be woven into the story to enhance authenticity and relatability? Additionally, it may be worth investigating current cultural or social trends that could be integrated into the narrative to make the content timely and compelling. These considerations could lead to deeper research on audience demographics, psychographics, and trending topics within the industry.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a story hook centered around a transformative customer journey, highlighting how the product or service resolves specific challenges or fulfills aspirations. The next step is to gather customer testimonials or case studies that exemplify this transformation and conduct research on current cultural trends that can be woven into the narrative. This approach aims to create content that is both relatable and timely, effectively engaging the target audience.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because the need for a compelling story hook is a recurring challenge in marketing, where capturing and maintaining audience attention is crucial. The pattern I notice is that I often start by focusing on the brand's message rather than the audience's perspective, which may limit the content's emotional resonance and relatability. Shifting to a meta perspective, I should regularly remind myself to prioritize the audience's journey and emotions, ensuring the content is more engaging and impactful."
