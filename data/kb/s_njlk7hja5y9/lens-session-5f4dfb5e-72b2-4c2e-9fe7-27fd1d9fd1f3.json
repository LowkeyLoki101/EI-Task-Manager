  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is to explore the potential of generating new insights or creative ideas by rearranging or combining existing prompts. The focus is on discovering novel perspectives or questions that may have been overlooked by simply altering the order or structure of the prompts. This approach seeks to enhance creativity and problem-solving by leveraging existing resources in unexpected ways.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of shuffling prompts randomly, you approached this like a puzzle where each prompt is a piece that could fit together to create a cohesive narrative or strategy? By viewing the prompts as interconnected parts of a larger picture, you might uncover deeper insights or themes that were not apparent when looking at them individually or in isolation. This perspective emphasizes the potential for synergy and holistic understanding when prompts are deliberately combined or sequenced.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What criteria should be used to determine the most meaningful or insightful combinations of prompts? How might the context or intended outcome shape the way prompts are shuffled and combined? Additionally, could developing a framework or tool to categorize and connect prompts based on themes or objectives enhance the process of generating innovative ideas? Exploring these questions could lead to a more structured and purposeful approach to prompt shuffling, potentially uncovering deeper layers of insight.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by developing a framework to categorize and connect prompts based on themes or objectives, I can more effectively generate innovative ideas through deliberate prompt shuffling. The next step is to create this framework, possibly starting with a small set of prompts, and experiment with different combinations to see which yield the most insightful or creative outcomes. This structured approach will guide future explorations and enhance the potential for discovering novel perspectives.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about shuffling prompts right now might stem from a desire to break free from routine thought patterns and unlock creativity. This pattern of seeking novelty through reorganization suggests a tendency to find value in reframing existing knowledge to uncover hidden connections or insights. By recognizing this pattern, you can intentionally harness it to challenge conventional thinking and stimulate innovative ideas."
