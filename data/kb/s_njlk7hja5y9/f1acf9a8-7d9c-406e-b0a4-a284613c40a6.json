  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that leveraging customer stories as marketing content will create authentic and engaging narratives that resonate with the audience. The next step is to establish a process for gathering these stories, perhaps by creating a feedback loop with customers through surveys or direct outreach, and then curating them for use in marketing campaigns. I will also explore platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to determine the best formats for showcasing these stories to maximize engagement and reach.",
