  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that reshuffling prompts can uncover hidden biases and foster new insights across various domains. The next step is to systematically shuffle a set of existing prompts and document the themes or patterns that emerge. I'll then analyze these results to identify any overlooked areas or assumptions in my thinking and explore how similar approaches could benefit problem-solving or learning strategies in other fields.",
