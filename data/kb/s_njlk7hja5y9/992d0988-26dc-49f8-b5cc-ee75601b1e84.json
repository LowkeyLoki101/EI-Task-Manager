  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that societal norms tend to emphasize efficiency and surface-level judgments over deeper understanding of motivations. As a next step, I will explore educational and organizational practices that prioritize empathy and critical thinking. I plan to research and potentially develop workshops or resources that train individuals to consistently seek and understand underlying motivations, thereby fostering environments that encourage deeper connections and problem-solving.",
