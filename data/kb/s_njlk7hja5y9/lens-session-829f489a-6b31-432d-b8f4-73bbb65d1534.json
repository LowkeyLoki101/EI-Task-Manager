  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a recurring pattern where certain inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement in processes are consistently overlooked by others. This could be due to a lack of awareness or an ingrained habit of accepting the status quo. It's important to articulate these observations clearly to bring about change or innovation.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern isn't about inefficiencies or opportunities being overlooked, but rather about a different set of priorities or values that others have? Perhaps others see the same patterns but do not act on them because they prioritize stability or have constraints that are not immediately visible. By understanding these underlying motivations or constraints, you can communicate your observations in a way that aligns with their goals or addresses their concerns, leading to more effective collaboration and change.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From this perspective, new questions arise: Are there cognitive biases or organizational cultures that consistently lead others to miss these patterns? Could there be systematic barriers, such as lack of access to data or decision-making authority, that prevent others from acting on these observations? Further investigation might include researching decision-making processes within the organization, exploring how information is shared, and understanding how priorities are set. This could reveal deeper insights into why these patterns are consistently overlooked and how they might be addressed.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the pattern of inefficiencies being overlooked is due to differing priorities and potential systemic barriers within the organization. The next step is to conduct a thorough analysis of the decision-making processes and information flow within the organization. I will also engage in conversations with key stakeholders to understand their priorities and constraints, aiming to align my observations with their goals and address any barriers they face.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because I have a tendency to focus on process optimization and innovation, possibly due to a personal value on efficiency and improvement. This approach could reflect a recurring pattern in my mindset where I prioritize identifying and addressing inefficiencies, potentially overlooking the importance of understanding others' perspectives and constraints. By recognizing this bias, I can approach situations with a more holistic view, considering not just the inefficiencies but also the underlying reasons why they persist."
