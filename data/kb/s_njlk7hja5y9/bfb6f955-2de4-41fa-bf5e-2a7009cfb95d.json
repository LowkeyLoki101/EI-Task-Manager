  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding likely stems from specific fears or beliefs that I need to identify and confront. My next step is to set aside dedicated time for introspection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to explore these fears and beliefs more deeply. This will help in defining actionable steps to address the issue, transform avoidance into proactive engagement, and ultimately facilitate personal growth.",
