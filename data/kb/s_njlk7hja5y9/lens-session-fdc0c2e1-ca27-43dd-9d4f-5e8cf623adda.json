  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is that I may not be engaging in self-reflection as thoroughly as I could, potentially missing out on insights that could lead to personal growth or better decision-making. This suggests a need to revisit questions that provoke thought and introspection, which I've neglected. Identifying and addressing these overlooked questions could help me gain new perspectives and clarity.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the possibility that not asking certain questions might actually be a sign of progress rather than neglect. Perhaps you haven't asked these questions because you've already integrated their lessons into your life, and now it's time to explore new areas of development. Alternatively, asking different questions altogether might open up new avenues for growth, suggesting that the focus should be on the diversity of questions rather than revisiting old ones.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying a recursive lens, new questions could include: \"What are the areas of my life that I haven't examined closely lately, and why?\" or \"How do the questions I choose to focus on shape my personal and professional growth?\" These questions deserve deeper investigation to understand how they influence decision-making processes and whether they might reveal overlooked opportunities for self-improvement or innovation. Exploring these areas could lead to identifying new, impactful questions that align with current goals and challenges.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that revisiting and diversifying the questions I ask myself can lead to significant personal growth and new insights. As a next step, I'll allocate time each week to reflect on different aspects of my life, consciously choosing questions that I haven't considered recently. This practice should help uncover new perspectives and opportunities for development.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it highlights a pattern of potentially neglecting regular introspection, which is crucial for personal growth and self-awareness. This pattern suggests a habit of sticking to familiar questions, potentially limiting new insights. By consciously stepping back to assess the diversity and depth of my self-inquiry, I can break this pattern and enhance my reflective practice."
