  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the assumption of AI always leading to increased efficiency in the energy sector might overlook potential complexities and costs. To address this, I will research case studies where AI implementation in energy led to unexpected challenges, focusing on the strategies used to mitigate these issues.
