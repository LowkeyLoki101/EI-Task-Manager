  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is to identify a unique and surprising pattern in solar technology that hasn't been widely recognized or explored. This involves examining trends, innovations, or overlooked aspects in the field that could serve as a compelling foundation for a story. The focus should be on uncovering an angle that challenges current perceptions or presents new opportunities within solar technology.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing solely on the technological aspects of solar power, the story explored the socio-economic impacts of solar technology adoption in unexpected regions or communities? By reframing the focus to examine how solar technology is transforming lives in areas that traditionally relied on other energy sources, the narrative could reveal surprising patterns of change and adaptation that challenge preconceived notions about energy dependency and innovation. This angle could uncover untold stories about empowerment, sustainability, and resilience in the context of solar technology.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By applying the recursive lens, new questions emerge, such as: How are unexpected communities leveraging solar technology to achieve energy independence, and what cultural shifts accompany this transition? Additionally, what are the long-term environmental impacts of increased solar adoption in these areas, and how might these influence global energy policies? Investigating these questions could reveal deeper narratives about the intersection of technology, culture, and environmental sustainability, warranting further research into specific case studies or comparative analyses across different regions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the unique story hook lies in uncovering how unexpected communities are using solar technology to foster socio-economic transformation and cultural shifts. The next step is to conduct research into specific regions or communities that have adopted solar power in innovative ways, focusing on the socio-economic and cultural impacts of this transition. This will involve gathering data and narratives that illustrate these changes, possibly through interviews or case studies.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this because I am seeking to create a narrative that not only informs but also captivates an audience by highlighting an underexplored aspect of solar technology. This reflects a pattern in my approach where I aim to uncover hidden stories or angles that challenge mainstream narratives and offer fresh perspectives. By using the meta-lens, I aim to ensure that my exploration remains grounded in relevance and innovation, pushing me to consider broader impacts and connections that might otherwise be overlooked."
