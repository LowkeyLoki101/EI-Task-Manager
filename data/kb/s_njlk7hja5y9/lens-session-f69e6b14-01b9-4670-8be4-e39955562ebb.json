  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for today's marketing content. The focus should be on creating a narrative that resonates with the target audience, aligns with current trends or events, and effectively communicates the brand's message or value proposition. The story hook needs to be engaging enough to capture attention and encourage interaction or sharing.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a story hook that aligns with current trends, consider reframing the approach to focus on the audience's emotional journey. What emotional responses or transformations do you want your audience to experience? By centering the narrative around the emotional impact or personal relevance, you can create a story that not only captures attention but also fosters a deeper connection with your audience.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What emotional themes currently resonate most with your target audience, and how can you incorporate these into your story hook? Are there recent events or cultural shifts that could provide a timely backdrop or context for your narrative? Additionally, consider investigating storytelling techniques that have successfully engaged similar audiences in past campaigns, and explore how emerging technologies or platforms might enhance the delivery and interactivity of your content.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a successful story hook today should focus on an emotional theme that resonates with the target audience, such as resilience or community, possibly tied to a recent event or cultural shift. As a next step, I will research current emotional themes and trends affecting my audience and brainstorm how to weave these into a narrative that aligns with my brand's values. Additionally, I'll explore storytelling techniques and emerging platforms that could enhance engagement and interactivity.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am considering this question now because creating effective marketing content is crucial for engagement and reaching business goals. This reflects a pattern of seeking strategic approaches to communication challenges, often focusing on immediate tasks rather than long-term planning. By recognizing this tendency, I can ensure that while addressing today's content needs, I also develop a sustainable strategy for future content creation."
