  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the communication inefficiencies stem from a lack of clear alignment and understanding of roles within the team. As a next step, I will propose regular alignment meetings to clarify objectives and roles, alongside implementing standardized communication protocols. Additionally, I plan to conduct a survey to gather team feedback on communication challenges and to benchmark against communication practices from successful teams within the organization.",
