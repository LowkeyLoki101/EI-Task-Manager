  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that there are areas of my life, particularly those that have recently changed or evolved, where I haven't fully explored new questions. As a next step, I'll allocate time to reflect on recent life changes, perhaps using journaling or a mind map, to identify these areas and formulate specific questions that could lead to deeper understanding and growth. This will help ensure I'm continually addressing both overlooked and unexplored aspects of my life.",
