  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a compelling story hook for creating effective marketing content today. The focus should be on understanding the current trends, audience preferences, and unique aspects of the product or service to craft a narrative that resonates and engages. The goal is to find a hook that not only captures attention but also aligns with the brand message and drives desired action.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on current trends and audience preferences, consider reframing the story hook around a timeless human emotion or experience that transcends trends, such as the pursuit of happiness, overcoming adversity, or the search for connection. Alternatively, approach it from the angle of solving a specific, relatable problem that the audience is currently facing, providing your product or service as the catalyst for transformation or relief. This shift in perspective can lead to a more authentic and resonant narrative that engages audiences on a deeper level.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive standpoint, consider exploring how the chosen story hook could evolve over time with changing societal dynamics or technological advancements. What future trends might influence the effectiveness of this story hook, and how can you adapt it to remain relevant and engaging? Additionally, investigate how similar hooks have been used in the past and analyze their success or failure, which could provide insights into crafting a more robust and adaptable narrative.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to craft a story hook that leverages a timeless human emotion, such as the pursuit of happiness or overcoming adversity, while also addressing a specific, current problem faced by the audience. The next step is to conduct a brief audience analysis to identify the most pressing issues they are experiencing today and align these findings with a universal theme. This approach will ensure the marketing content is both relevant and deeply resonant.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because crafting a compelling story hook is crucial for creating impactful marketing content that stands out in a saturated market. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing heavily on trends and audience preferences, potentially overlooking the power of universal human experiences and emotions. By stepping back, I can ensure my approach balances current relevancy with timeless storytelling elements, creating a more holistic and engaging narrative."
