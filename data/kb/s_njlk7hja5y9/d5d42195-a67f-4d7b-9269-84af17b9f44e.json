  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a problem due to underlying fears or assumptions that may not be entirely rational. As a next step, I will identify one small action I can take to start addressing this issue, such as reaching out to someone who has experience in this area for advice or dedicating a specific time to reflect on the problem in a constructive way. By taking these initial steps, I hope to break the cycle of avoidance and begin making progress.",
