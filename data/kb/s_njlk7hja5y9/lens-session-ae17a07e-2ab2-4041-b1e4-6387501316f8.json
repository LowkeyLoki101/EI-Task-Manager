  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem-solving approach that involves starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to identify the steps needed to achieve it. This method, known as backward reasoning or reverse engineering, can help in clarifying the necessary actions and resources required by focusing on the end goal first. By framing the problem in this way, I can better understand the dependencies and constraints that might not be apparent when working forwards.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the problem-solving process itself, consider the emotional or motivational impact of starting from the end. By visualizing the successful outcome first, you can instill a sense of confidence and clarity, which might drive more effective decision-making and problem-solving. This perspective shift emphasizes the psychological benefits of backward reasoning, turning the approach into a tool for boosting morale and maintaining focus throughout the process.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of the recursive lens, new questions emerge: How might this backward approach be applied to different types of problems, such as creative projects or technical challenges? What are the potential pitfalls or limitations of consistently using backward reasoning, and how can they be mitigated? This invites deeper research into various domains where reverse engineering is used and the cognitive and strategic implications of altering traditional problem-solving methodologies.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that using a backward approach can facilitate clearer problem-solving by focusing on the desired outcome and identifying necessary steps to achieve it. The next step is to apply this method to a current challenge I'm facing, document the process, and evaluate its effectiveness compared to traditional forward reasoning. This will help assess the practical benefits and limitations of reverse engineering in my specific context.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about approaching the problem backwards because I'm seeking a more structured and potentially more insightful way to reach my goals. This approach might reflect a pattern in my thinking where I am drawn to strategies that emphasize clarity and efficiency by focusing on end results. By recognizing this, I can leverage my preference for clear outcomes to enhance both my problem-solving and motivational strategies, ensuring they are aligned with my natural inclinations."
