  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I see the problem as questioning the validity of an underlying assumption that is influencing my decision-making or perspective. The direct issue is identifying which specific assumption I am holding that may not be accurate or might be leading me astray in my thinking or actions. The goal is to pinpoint this assumption to evaluate its validity and impact.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying a potentially faulty assumption, consider reframing the problem as an opportunity to explore alternative perspectives entirely. What if the issue isn't just about a wrong assumption, but rather a lack of diverse viewpoints informing your decision-making process? By broadening the scope to include different angles and insights, you may uncover not only the assumption in question but also other valuable perspectives that enhance your understanding and approach.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively examining the trigger, consider what underlying beliefs might be influencing your assumptions. Are these beliefs based on outdated information, cultural biases, or limited experiences? Additionally, explore how challenging these assumptions could impact other areas of your decision-making or understanding. What new insights could emerge if you actively sought to question and diversify these foundational beliefs?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current assumptions are possibly shaped by outdated information or limited perspectives. To address this, I will actively seek out diverse viewpoints and new data to reassess these assumptions, ensuring they are well-informed and relevant. The next step is to engage with individuals who have different experiences or expertise and review recent literature or research related to the topic at hand.",

  "meta_lensStep": "Thinking about assumptions right now might stem from a pattern of seeking certainty or validation in your decision-making process. This reflects a recurring approach where you prioritize identifying and correcting potential missteps to ensure accuracy and effectiveness. By stepping back, you can recognize this tendency and consider integrating a broader exploration of diverse perspectives, which may not only correct the assumption but also enrich your understanding and adaptability."
