  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is determining a compelling story hook for today's marketing content that resonates with the target audience and effectively communicates the brand's message. I see the need to identify a narrative that not only captures attention but also aligns with current trends and audience interests to enhance engagement and conversion. The goal is to craft a hook that is both relevant and memorable.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on finding a single compelling story hook, approach it from the perspective of creating a series of micro-stories that can be adapted and personalized for different segments of your audience. Consider how each micro-story could be tailored to reflect the unique values or current interests of specific audience groups, allowing for a more dynamic and engaging marketing strategy that evolves alongside audience feedback and trending topics. This reframing emphasizes flexibility and adaptability in storytelling, rather than searching for a one-size-fits-all solution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying a recursive lens to the idea of crafting marketing story hooks raises questions about the ongoing evolution of audience interests and how frequently those interests shift. It prompts further investigation into the mechanisms for consistently gathering real-time feedback from the audience to ensure the stories remain relevant. Additionally, it could involve exploring new technologies or platforms that aid in quickly adapting and disseminating these micro-stories to capture emerging trends effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is to develop a suite of micro-stories tailored to different audience segments, using data-driven insights to ensure each story aligns with current trends and audience interests. The next step is to utilize analytics tools to gather real-time feedback on audience preferences and engagement patterns. This data will inform the creation and adaptation of these micro-stories, ensuring they remain relevant and impactful.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because there's an immediate need to create engaging marketing content that resonates with the audience. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking a single, standout solution for storytelling, which can sometimes limit creativity and adaptability. By stepping back, I recognize the importance of embracing a more flexible approach, allowing for multiple narrative possibilities that can be tailored and refined based on real-time audience engagement and feedback."
