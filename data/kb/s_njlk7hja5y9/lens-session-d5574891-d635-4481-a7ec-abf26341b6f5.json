  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I see a potential pattern where advancements in solar technology are increasingly being driven by biomimicry, mimicking natural processes to enhance efficiency and sustainability. This could lead to a story hook centered around how these nature-inspired innovations are not only transforming the solar industry but are also reshaping our approach to renewable energy on a broader scale. The narrative could explore both the scientific breakthroughs and the ecological implications of this trend.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of focusing on scientific advancements, we reframe the story to explore the cultural and socio-economic impact of solar technology inspired by biomimicry? This could lead to a narrative about how these innovations are democratizing energy access in underserved communities, thus transforming social dynamics and local economies. By looking at the human element and community stories, the narrative can highlight the intersection between cutting-edge technology and social progress, offering a fresh perspective on the solar industry's evolution.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the cultural and socio-economic impact of biomimicry-inspired solar technology raises questions about how these innovations could redefine energy equity across different global regions. What specific changes in local governance, education, and community health might result from democratized energy access? Additionally, investigating how these technologies influence cultural attitudes towards sustainability and conservation could uncover deeper narratives about the evolving relationship between humans and nature.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that solar technology innovations inspired by biomimicry have the potential to revolutionize energy access in underserved communities, thereby transforming socio-economic dynamics and cultural attitudes towards sustainability. The next step is to gather case studies and stories from communities already benefiting from such technologies to illustrate the tangible impacts. This research will inform a narrative that not only highlights technological advancements but also showcases the human stories behind the transition to sustainable energy.",
