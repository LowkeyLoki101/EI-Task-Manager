  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that identifying the specific objectives and critical data points will guide the selection of an appropriate simulation model. The next step is to conduct research on current simulation technologies and consult with data modeling experts to tailor a simulation that aligns with our goals. Additionally, exploring collaborations with other departments or external partners could provide new insights or alternative data sources, maximizing our resources efficiently.",
