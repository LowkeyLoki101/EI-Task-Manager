  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea here is about exploring new perspectives and insights by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling the prompts, the goal is to discover unique combinations and connections that may not have been initially apparent, potentially leading to innovative questions or solutions. This approach seeks to leverage the creative potential of randomness within structured thought.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing this from a different perspective, consider the idea of shuffling prompts not just for innovation but as a tool for sparking empathy and understanding. By rearranging prompts, you might uncover questions that highlight diverse viewpoints or challenge your assumptions, fostering a more inclusive approach to problem-solving. This reframing shifts the focus from merely seeking novelty to also enhancing perspective-taking and broadening your cognitive horizons.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What cognitive biases might influence the way I interpret new prompts that emerge from shuffling? Additionally, how might the context in which these prompts are shuffled (e.g., time of day, emotional state) affect the insights gained? Exploring these questions could lead to deeper research on the impact of randomness in creativity and problem-solving, as well as the role of environmental and psychological factors in shaping our responses to new ideas.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to the emergence of innovative questions and insights by breaking the routine of linear thinking. As a next step, I will set aside time to randomly shuffle a set of my existing prompts and observe the new combinations that arise. I will document any novel perspectives or ideas that emerge, paying attention to how my current context or cognitive biases might influence my interpretations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts right now to break free from habitual thinking patterns and to discover novel insights or solutions that I might otherwise overlook. This reflects a recurring pattern of seeking creativity through disruption and randomness, an approach I often use to challenge my assumptions and expand my cognitive flexibility. By stepping back, I can also recognize this as a strategy for enhancing empathy and understanding by encountering diverse viewpoints that emerge from these new combinations."
