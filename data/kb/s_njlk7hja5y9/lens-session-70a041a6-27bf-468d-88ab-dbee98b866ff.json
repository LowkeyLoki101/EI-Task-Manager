  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a significant question that has been overlooked for a while in your personal or professional life. This involves introspection to uncover areas that may need attention but have been neglected. The goal is to pinpoint a question that, when addressed, could lead to meaningful insights or improvements.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question that has been overlooked, reframe the approach by considering what areas of your life have remained unchanged for a long time. Ask yourself, \"What aspects of my life have I assumed to be stable or unproblematic but might benefit from reevaluation?\" This angle encourages you to challenge the status quo and explore potential areas for growth or innovation that may have been taken for granted.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From exploring the question of overlooked inquiries, new questions emerge such as: \"What assumptions am I operating under that need reevaluation?\" or \"What areas in my life have I not challenged or disrupted recently?\" Investigating these questions could lead to deeper insights about personal growth opportunities or innovation in professional settings. This exploration deserves further research into methodologies for questioning assumptions and strategies for embracing change in stable areas of life.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are areas of my life that I've assumed to be stable that might benefit from reevaluation. As a next step, I will set aside time this week to reflect on specific aspects of my personal and professional life that have remained unchanged for a long time, listing out assumptions I hold about them. This list will guide me to identify which areas could lead to meaningful growth or improvements if revisited.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it prompts reflection on areas of my life that might have become stagnant or overlooked. This aligns with a recurring pattern of self-improvement and growth, where I periodically reassess my priorities and assumptions to ensure they align with my current goals and values. By stepping back, I can identify any blind spots or outdated beliefs that may be hindering progress."
