  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption I'm making is that AI will predominantly enhance efficiency and optimize processes in the energy sector. By considering the reverse, I would explore the possibility that AI could introduce complexities or inefficiencies, such as increased dependency on technology or unforeseen operational challenges. This shift in perspective may lead to a balanced approach, ensuring that AI implementations are critically evaluated for both benefits and potential drawbacks.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the assumption that AI's role in the energy sector is not just about optimizing existing processes but transforming the very nature of energy production and consumption. If I consider this angle, the outcome changes to exploring how AI could drive the development of entirely new energy paradigms, such as decentralized energy systems or personalized energy solutions. This approach prompts a broader vision where AI not only improves efficiency but also fosters innovation and redefines the industry's landscape.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What new assumptions could be explored regarding AI's impact on the energy sector, such as the potential social or environmental implications of AI-driven energy solutions? Additionally, how might AI's role in energy intersect with broader technological and economic trends, like the rise of smart cities or shifts in global energy policy? Investigating these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of AI's transformative potential and its ripple effects across various facets of the energy industry and society at large.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI is primarily viewed as a tool for enhancing efficiency in the energy sector, it also has the potential to fundamentally transform energy systems and paradigms. As a next step, I will conduct a detailed analysis of case studies where AI has disrupted traditional energy practices, focusing on both efficiency gains and transformative innovations. This will help identify emerging trends and inform strategic decisions about AI investments in the energy sector.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By examining this trigger through a meta-lens, I'm recognizing a recurring pattern in my approach: an initial focus on optimizing existing systems with technology. This reflection prompts me to consider not just incremental improvements, but also transformative possibilities and potential pitfalls. By challenging my assumptions, I can adopt a more holistic view that balances innovation with critical evaluation, ensuring that AI's integration in the energy sector is both forward-thinking and mindful of unintended consequences."
