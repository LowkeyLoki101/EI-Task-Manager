  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue that causes discomfort or anxiety, such as a challenging decision at work, a personal relationship conflict, or a financial concern. By not addressing it, I might be experiencing stress or a sense of being overwhelmed, which can impact other areas of my life. It's important to identify the specific issue and consider why I might be avoiding it, so I can start working towards a solution.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't just a source of stress, but also an opportunity for growth or positive change? By reframing it as a chance to learn and develop new skills or improve my life, I could transform my perspective and motivation. Instead of viewing it as a daunting challenge, I could see it as a valuable experience that could lead to personal or professional advancement.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying beliefs or fears are causing me to avoid this problem? How might my avoidance be affecting other aspects of my life, such as my relationships or mental health? Investigating these questions could lead to a deeper understanding of the root causes of my avoidance and open up pathways to addressing not just this issue, but similar challenges in the future.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is a potential source of growth, and addressing it could lead to personal or professional development. As a next step, I will identify the specific issue I'm avoiding, perhaps by journaling or discussing it with a trusted friend or mentor, and then outline a plan to tackle it incrementally, focusing on the potential positive outcomes.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this problem now because avoiding it has likely been a persistent pattern in my approach to challenges, possibly due to a fear of failure or discomfort with uncertainty. Recognizing this avoidance pattern is crucial, as it reveals an opportunity to develop resilience by facing problems head-on and seeking proactive solutions, rather than allowing them to linger and potentially worsen. By understanding the underlying reasons for avoidance, I can break this cycle and cultivate a more constructive mindset towards challenges."
