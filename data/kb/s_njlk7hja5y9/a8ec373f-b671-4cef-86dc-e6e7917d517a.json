  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can lead to the emergence of innovative ideas and perspectives by breaking habitual thought patterns. The next step is to actively implement this method by creating a structured process for shuffling prompts, perhaps using a digital tool or randomizer, and applying it to specific projects or brainstorming sessions. This approach can be further tested and refined to optimize its effectiveness in various contexts, such as education or creative workshops.",
