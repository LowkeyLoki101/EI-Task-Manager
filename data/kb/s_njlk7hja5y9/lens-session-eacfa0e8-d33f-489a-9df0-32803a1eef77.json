  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is to explore the potential for creativity and new insights by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling my own prompts, I aim to discover fresh combinations and perspectives that could lead to novel questions or ideas that I hadn't considered before. This process seeks to uncover hidden connections and inspire innovative thinking.",
  "reframeStep": "What if, instead of shuffling prompts to find new ideas, you curated them based on a specific theme or desired outcome? By intentionally grouping them, you might uncover targeted insights and patterns that align with a particular goal or challenge. This approach could lead to more focused and actionable ideas, rather than relying solely on the randomness of shuffling.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, a key question emerges: How might the unexpected juxtaposition of concepts lead to breakthroughs in problem-solving? This prompts further investigation into the cognitive processes behind creativity and whether randomness or structured methodologies are more effective in sparking innovation. Additionally, exploring how other disciplines utilize similar techniques could provide insights into optimizing this approach for different contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can indeed lead to unexpected and creative combinations, but intentionally curating them based on themes or goals might be more effective for targeted insights. As a next step, I will experiment with both methods: shuffling prompts randomly and curating them intentionally around a specific theme. I will then compare the outcomes to determine which approach yields more valuable or actionable ideas.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking novelty and unexpected insights, a common pattern when I'm feeling creatively stuck or seeking a fresh perspective. This approach reflects a habitual reliance on randomness to spark innovation, rather than strategically leveraging existing knowledge or focusing on a specific objective. By recognizing this pattern, I can explore more intentional methods for generating ideas, such as thematic curation or collaboration with others."
