  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that reverse engineering this problem will reveal new insights and potentially overlooked solutions by identifying the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome. The next step is to clearly define the end goal and systematically work backwards to outline the required conditions and actions. I'll select a specific problem to apply this approach to and evaluate its effectiveness compared to traditional methods.",
