  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I'm avoiding thinking about is likely a significant issue that causes discomfort or anxiety, potentially related to personal relationships, career decisions, or financial responsibilities. By not addressing it, I'm possibly prolonging stress or preventing progress in that area. It's important to identify the specific issue so that I can start taking steps to address it and alleviate any ongoing stress it may be causing.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't a source of anxiety but rather an opportunity for growth that I've been overlooking? Instead of viewing it as a burden, I could see it as a chance to learn new skills or strengthen relationships. By changing my perspective, I might discover that addressing the issue could lead to personal or professional development that I had not previously considered.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying fears or beliefs are causing me to avoid thinking about this problem? Could exploring these fears reveal deeper issues that need addressing, such as a fear of failure or a lack of confidence in my problem-solving abilities? Additionally, what small, manageable steps can I take to begin confronting this problem, and how can I measure progress to ensure I'm moving forward? Exploring these questions could lead to a better understanding of the root causes of avoidance and actionable strategies for overcoming them.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding involves a fear of failure or lack of confidence, which suggests an opportunity for personal growth. My next step is to identify the specific issue by journaling about my fears and beliefs related to this problem, and then outline small, actionable steps to address it. This approach will help me gradually confront and manage the issue, transforming it into an opportunity for development.",

By frequently avoiding certain issues, I might be reinforcing a cycle of procrastination and missed opportunities. Recognizing this pattern can help me take proactive steps to break it, thereby improving my overall well-being and effectiveness in addressing challenges."
