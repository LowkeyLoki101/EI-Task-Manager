  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by systematically shuffling prompts and involving others in the process, we can generate a wider range of innovative ideas and insights. The next step is to design a collaborative exercise where participants contribute and rearrange prompts, and then evaluate the outcomes for creativity and novelty. I will also explore using AI tools to aid in the randomization and combination of prompts to ensure diverse and unexpected results.",
