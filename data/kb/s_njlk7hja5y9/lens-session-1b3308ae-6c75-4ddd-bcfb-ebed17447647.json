  "frameStep": "I am avoiding thinking about the problem of procrastination related to important tasks or decisions in my personal or professional life. This avoidance may stem from fear of failure, lack of motivation, or not knowing where to start. Addressing this issue is crucial to improving productivity and achieving my goals.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing procrastination as a problem stemming from fear or lack of motivation, consider it as a signal that the tasks or decisions might be misaligned with your interests or values. This perspective suggests that the issue isn't about avoidance, but rather an opportunity to reassess and prioritize goals that are genuinely meaningful to you. By focusing on tasks that resonate with your personal or professional values, you may naturally find the motivation to engage with them more fully.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring procrastination further, consider the root causes and ask: What specific tasks or decisions are consistently avoided, and why might they be misaligned with my interests or values? Investigate potential underlying beliefs or external pressures influencing these choices. Additionally, research strategies or frameworks for aligning tasks with personal values and interests to enhance motivation and productivity.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that procrastination arises from tasks misaligned with my values or interests. The next step is to identify these tasks, analyze why they feel misaligned, and explore adjustments that could make them more aligned with my personal or professional values. To take action, I will allocate time this week to reflect on my current task list, prioritize them based on alignment with my core values, and develop a plan to address or delegate tasks that donâ€™t fit.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this now because recognizing and addressing avoidance patterns is essential for personal growth and effectiveness. By stepping back with a meta-lens, I can identify that my recurring pattern involves not just avoiding tasks, but also avoiding self-reflection on whether these tasks align with my deeper values and interests. This realization encourages me to regularly evaluate my goals and commitments to ensure they are genuinely meaningful, thereby reducing procrastination."
