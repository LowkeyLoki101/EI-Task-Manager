  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the potential for innovation and creativity by rearranging existing prompts to generate new ideas or perspectives. By shuffling my own prompts, I can uncover unexpected connections and insights that were previously overlooked, leading to novel concepts or solutions. The goal is to identify and harness these emergent prompts to enhance creativity and problem-solving.",
  "reframeStep": "What if I approached this from the perspective of collaboration rather than individual creativity? By inviting others to shuffle and interpret my prompts, I could gain fresh insights and perspectives that I might not have considered on my own. This could lead to a richer tapestry of ideas and a more dynamic exploration of potential solutions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What methods or tools could be developed to facilitate the shuffling and recombination of prompts in a way that maximizes creativity and discovery? How might the concept of shuffling be applied beyond prompts—such as in data sets, stories, or concepts—to uncover new patterns or narratives? Additionally, could this approach be used in educational settings to encourage students to think outside the box and develop innovative problem-solving skills?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by shuffling my own prompts and inviting others to interpret them, I can unlock new perspectives and ideas that I wouldn't discover alone. As a next step, I will develop a collaborative platform or workshop where participants can shuffle and reinterpret prompts collectively, fostering a dynamic exchange of insights and creativity. This approach will help test the hypothesis and refine methods for maximizing the creative potential of prompt shuffling.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling my prompts right now because I'm seeking new ways to spark creativity and innovation. This approach reflects a pattern of exploring novel combinations and perspectives to break free from conventional thinking. By examining the process with a meta-lens, I recognize my tendency to rely on internal resources for creativity, and this prompts me to consider more collaborative or external inputs to diversify and enrich the creative process."
