  "trigger": "What unique story hook could I develop by exploring a surprising pattern in solar technology that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves identifying a unique pattern in solar technology advancements or applications that has been overlooked by mainstream narratives. Specifically, this could involve discovering unexpected efficiencies, new applications of solar tech in unconventional industries, or socio-economic impacts that are not widely recognized. The goal is to unearth a compelling angle that highlights how solar technology is transforming in ways not typically covered, potentially influencing both technological innovation and societal adaptation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the technological advancements or efficiencies of solar technology, consider reframing the narrative to explore the human and cultural dimensions. What if you examined how solar technology is unexpectedly influencing cultural practices or community dynamics in remote areas? By shifting the perspective from a purely technical angle to a socio-cultural one, you could uncover stories about how solar adoption is reshaping traditions, enabling new forms of community interaction, or even altering local economies in ways that have not been widely discussed.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From a recursive perspective, consider investigating how solar technology might be influencing migration patterns or urban development in both developed and developing regions. Are there emerging trends in how solar power availability is impacting decisions about where people choose to live or work? Additionally, delve into how cultural narratives around sustainability and self-sufficiency are evolving in communities newly exposed to solar technologyâ€”how might these narratives be shaping identities or influencing social cohesion? These angles could reveal deeper societal transformations driven by solar adoption.",
  "closureStep": "Based on the exploration of socio-cultural and migration impacts of solar technology, my working hypothesis is that solar adoption is significantly influencing community structures and identity, particularly in remote or developing regions. My next step is to conduct interviews and gather qualitative data from communities experiencing these changes, focusing on how solar technology is reshaping cultural practices, economic opportunities, and migration patterns. This data will help craft a compelling narrative that highlights these underreported transformations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because I'm searching for an innovative narrative that could set my work apart in a crowded field, potentially offering fresh insights or creating a new dialogue. This reflects a pattern of seeking stories that challenge conventional perspectives and push me to explore underrepresented angles, combining technical and socio-cultural dimensions to craft a more holistic and engaging narrative."
