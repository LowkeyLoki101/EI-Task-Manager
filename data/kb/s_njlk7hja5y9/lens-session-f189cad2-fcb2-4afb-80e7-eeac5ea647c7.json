  "trigger": "If I wanted to make marketing content today, what story hook would I use?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying an engaging story hook that captivates the target audience and aligns with the brand's message for today's marketing content. The goal is to find a narrative angle that is both timely and relevant, which could involve current events, trending topics, or a unique angle on a well-known issue. The focus should be on making the content compelling enough to spark interest and encourage interaction or sharing among the audience.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on current events or trending topics, reframe the challenge by considering the emotional journey or transformation that your audience experiences with your product or service. What personal stories or testimonials can be highlighted to create a deeper connection? Alternatively, approach it from a problem-solving angle: what persistent issue does your audience face that your offering addresses in an innovative or unexpected way?",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the idea of focusing on the emotional journey or transformation, new questions emerge: What are the specific emotional triggers for your audience, and how can these be authentically woven into a narrative? Additionally, exploring deeper into the problem-solving angle raises questions about the unique solutions your brand offers and how these can be demonstrated through compelling storytelling or case studies. Further research could involve understanding customer personas more intimately or analyzing successful competitor campaigns for inspiration.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that a story hook centered around the emotional journey and transformation experienced by users of our product will resonate most effectively with the target audience. The next step is to gather and analyze customer testimonials or case studies to identify common emotional triggers and transformations. This will inform the creation of a narrative that highlights these elements and aligns with our brand's message. Additionally, I will explore how our unique solutions address persistent audience challenges, potentially through a problem-solving angle in our storytelling.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm aiming to create marketing content that not only captures attention but also resonates deeply with the audience, driving engagement and brand loyalty. The pattern I notice is a tendency to default to external trends or events for story hooks, instead of leveraging the inherent stories and transformations within my own brand or customer experiences. By using a meta-lens, I can recognize this pattern and shift towards a more introspective approach, focusing on authentic narratives that highlight personal connections and solutions my brand provides."
