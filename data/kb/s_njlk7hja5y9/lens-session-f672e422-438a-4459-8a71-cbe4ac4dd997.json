  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a question that I have not considered or reflected upon recently. This involves examining areas of my life or mindset that may have gone unchallenged or unexamined for some time. The goal is to uncover a potentially overlooked aspect that could benefit from introspection or reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on a question I haven't asked myself, I could reframe this by considering what assumptions I haven't challenged lately. By examining the underlying beliefs that guide my daily decisions and routines, I might discover areas that could use a fresh perspective or innovative solutions. This shift in focus may open up new avenues for growth and self-discovery.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From exploring what questions I haven't asked myself, new inquiries arise: What areas of my life have I neglected to evaluate, and why might I be avoiding them? Additionally, what aspects of my current mindset or routine could benefit from a complete overhaul? These questions deserve deeper investigation as they can lead to significant personal growth by challenging deeply ingrained habits and beliefs.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are areas of my life where assumptions have gone unchecked, possibly hindering my growth. My next step is to actively identify one assumption in a specific area of my life, such as my career path or personal relationships, and challenge it by seeking alternative perspectives or evidence. This will involve dedicating time to reflect and possibly engage with resources or people that can provide fresh insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I sense there might be aspects of my life or mindset that have become stagnant or routine, potentially limiting my personal growth. The pattern I'm repeating involves occasionally overlooking the importance of questioning my assumptions and beliefs, which can lead to missed opportunities for innovation and deeper understanding. By stepping back and challenging these ingrained patterns, I aim to foster a more dynamic and introspective approach to my personal development."
