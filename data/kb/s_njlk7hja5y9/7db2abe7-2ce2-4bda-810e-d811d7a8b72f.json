  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that the integration of solar technology with biotechnology or AI presents a unique and underexplored narrative about how these fields converge to revolutionize energy systems and broader industries. The next step is to research specific case studies or real-world applications where solar technology intersects with biotech or AI, focusing on both technological advancements and their societal impacts. This approach will help identify a compelling story hook that highlights innovative uses and the potential challenges or ethical considerations involved.",
