  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves examining my assumptions about AI's role in the energy sector. The key assumption could be that AI will primarily drive efficiency and cost reduction. By considering the reverse, I would explore the possibility that AI could also introduce complexities or inefficiencies, leading to different strategic decisions or investments in energy technology.",
  "reframeStep": "By reframing the original trigger, I could consider the assumption that AI in the energy sector is inherently beneficial. Instead, if I viewed AI as a potential disruptor that might initially introduce challenges—such as increased cybersecurity risks or a dependency that stifles human innovation—this perspective could alter my approach to integrating AI. It would encourage a more cautious strategy, emphasizing robust security measures and the development of complementary human skills alongside AI advancements.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring the recursive lens, new questions arise such as: What specific inefficiencies or complexities could AI introduce in the energy sector? How might these challenges impact regulatory frameworks or the development of human skills? This deserves deeper research into historical case studies where technology disrupted industries, and an investigation into current AI deployment strategies to prepare for potential unintended consequences.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI in the energy sector is assumed to primarily enhance efficiency, considering the reverse highlights potential challenges such as increased cybersecurity risks and dependency issues. My next step is to conduct research into case studies where AI integration initially led to unforeseen complexities, and to develop a strategy that incorporates robust security measures and continuous human skill development to mitigate these risks.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this trigger right now because it's essential to challenge my assumptions to develop a comprehensive and balanced understanding of AI's impact on the energy sector. The pattern I might be repeating is an over-reliance on the optimistic narrative that technology always leads to progress, without critically evaluating potential drawbacks. By applying a meta-lens, I can recognize this bias and purposefully integrate a broader perspective that includes potential challenges and risks, leading to a more nuanced strategy in AI deployment."
