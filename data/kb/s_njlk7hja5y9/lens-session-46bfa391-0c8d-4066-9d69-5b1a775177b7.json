  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding thinking about is likely an issue that feels overwhelming or uncomfortable to address, such as a difficult personal relationship, a challenging work situation, or a crucial decision that has significant consequences. By not confronting it, I might be experiencing anxiety or stress, which could be impacting other areas of my life. Addressing this problem head-on could lead to a resolution and reduce the mental burden it is currently causing.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the problem I'm avoiding isn't actually as daunting as it seems, but rather an opportunity for growth and learning? By reframing it as a chance to develop new skills or improve an aspect of my life, I might approach it with more curiosity and less fear. This shift in perspective could transform my avoidance into a proactive mindset, allowing me to tackle the issue with a sense of empowerment and purpose.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What underlying beliefs or fears are causing me to avoid addressing this problem? Are there specific patterns in my past where avoidance has impacted my ability to resolve issues effectively? It might be valuable to investigate whether there are any recurring themes or triggers that lead me to avoid certain problems, and how I can develop strategies to confront similar challenges in the future with greater resilience.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is tied to underlying fears or beliefs that have created a pattern of avoidance in my life. My next step is to identify this specific issue and break it down into smaller, manageable tasks that I can address incrementally. By setting a timeline and specific goals, I can approach this problem with a structured plan, reducing its perceived magnitude and increasing my confidence in resolving it.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By considering the meta-lens, I'm recognizing a recurring pattern of avoidance when faced with daunting challenges, which might stem from a fear of failure or discomfort with uncertainty. This introspection highlights a tendency to procrastinate or distract myself rather than engaging directly with the issue. Acknowledging this pattern allows me to consciously choose to confront these challenges by adopting strategies that promote resilience and growth, thereby transforming avoidance into a proactive approach."
