  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that I am avoiding a problem that involves a challenging conversation or a task that feels overwhelming. The next step is to identify one specific issue that I've been procrastinating on and set aside time to address it directly, perhaps by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. I will schedule a time this week to tackle this problem, using the approach of viewing it as a growth opportunity.",
