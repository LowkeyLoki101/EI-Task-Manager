  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "I am assuming that my current understanding or belief about a specific situation is correct when it might not be. This assumption might be leading to decisions or conclusions that aren't well-founded. The problem is to identify and question the underlying assumptions that could be inaccurate or misguided.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on the assumption that my understanding might be incorrect, I could reframe the situation by considering that my assumption might be incomplete rather than wrong. This perspective opens up the possibility that there are additional factors, perspectives, or data points that I haven't yet explored. By shifting the focus from being right or wrong to being comprehensive, I can better navigate the complexities of the situation and make more informed decisions.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the potential biases or cognitive shortcuts influencing my assumptions? How can I systematically validate or challenge these assumptions with evidence? Additionally, what are the implications of my assumptions on the stakeholders involved, and how can their perspectives inform a more comprehensive understanding? These questions warrant deeper investigation to ensure well-rounded and accurate conclusions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that my current understanding of the situation may be incomplete rather than entirely wrong. The next step is to actively seek out additional perspectives and data points, particularly from stakeholders who might be affected by my assumptions. I will gather evidence to either validate or challenge these assumptions, ensuring a more comprehensive and informed decision-making process.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about this assumption because I recognize a recurring pattern of seeking certainty and correctness in my understanding, which might limit my openness to new information and perspectives. By consistently questioning assumptions, I aim to break the habit of clinging to potentially incomplete or outdated beliefs, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive approach to problem-solving and decision-making. This reflection helps me cultivate a mindset that values continuous learning and growth over static certainty."
