  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "I see a problem of avoidance, where I'm not confronting an issue that might be causing discomfort or requiring difficult decisions. This avoidance could be hindering progress in personal or professional areas of my life. Clearly identifying what this issue is can help in addressing it directly, rather than letting it linger and potentially grow more challenging over time.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of viewing this as a problem of avoidance, reframe it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. Consider that what you're avoiding might be a chance to learn more about your values, priorities, and resilience. By approaching it as a journey to uncover hidden strengths and insights, you transform the challenge into an empowering experience that can lead to personal development and enhanced decision-making skills.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens raises several questions: What specific fears or beliefs are contributing to this avoidance? Are there underlying patterns or past experiences influencing my current hesitation to address this problem? Investigating these questions may reveal deeper psychological barriers or habitual behaviors that need to be understood and re-evaluated, potentially leading to more effective strategies for confronting the avoided issue.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding likely stems from specific fears or beliefs that I need to identify and confront. My next step is to set aside dedicated time for introspection, perhaps through journaling or meditation, to explore these fears and beliefs more deeply. This will help in defining actionable steps to address the issue, transform avoidance into proactive engagement, and ultimately facilitate personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it's a recurring pattern where I tend to sidestep issues that feel uncomfortable or uncertain, possibly due to fear of confronting difficult emotions or outcomes. Recognizing this pattern is crucial as it highlights a potential habit of avoidance that could limit personal growth and resilience. By addressing this pattern, I can shift my approach to be more proactive in facing challenges and making informed decisions."
