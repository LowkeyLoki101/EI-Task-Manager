  "trigger": "What would happen if I approached this problem backwards?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves exploring the potential outcomes and insights gained by reversing the typical approach to a given problem. By considering the problem from its conclusion or desired outcome and working backwards, one might uncover overlooked assumptions, alternative solutions, or more efficient pathways. This approach can reveal dependencies and critical steps that are not evident when tackling the problem in a conventional, forward manner.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on the steps to reverse-engineer the problem, consider the motivations and perspectives of those involved. What if the problem is re-evaluated by prioritizing the interests and desired outcomes of all stakeholders? This shift might highlight new priorities or constraints that reshape the possible solutions, potentially uncovering more collaborative or innovative approaches that align with everyone's goals.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the idea of approaching a problem backwards raises questions about the broader contexts in which reverse thinking can be applied. How might this approach influence problem-solving in different fields, such as engineering, design, or policy-making? Additionally, what are the cognitive biases or mental models that typically prevent individuals from considering backward approaches, and how can these be addressed or leveraged to enhance creative problem-solving? These questions warrant deeper investigation to understand the potential benefits and limitations of reverse problem-solving across various domains.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that approaching a problem backwards can reveal hidden assumptions and alternative solutions that might not be evident with a conventional approach. The next step is to select a specific problem and deliberately map out the desired outcome first, then work backwards to identify all necessary steps and stakeholders involved. This will help test the effectiveness of reverse thinking in practice and refine the approach based on real-world insights.",

  "meta_lensStep": "By thinking about approaching the problem backwards, I'm challenging the conventional sequence of problem-solving, which often leads to linear thinking and potential blind spots. This pattern of reverse thinking encourages a shift in perspective that can unearth hidden assumptions and dependencies. It's a recurring approach I use to disrupt routine methodologies, aiming to enhance creativity and uncover innovative solutions by questioning default processes and exploring alternative pathways."
