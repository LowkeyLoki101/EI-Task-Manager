  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is to create marketing content that invites the audience to share their personal experiences related to the product or service. The next step is to identify the most effective platforms, such as social media or community forums, to facilitate this engagement. Additionally, I'll develop a strategy for incentivizing participation, perhaps through contests or rewards, and use analytics to track which stories resonate most with the audience, refining the approach based on these insights.",
