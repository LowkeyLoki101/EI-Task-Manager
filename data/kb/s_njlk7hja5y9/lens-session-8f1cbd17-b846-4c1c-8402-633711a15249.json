  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is to explore the potential of creating new prompts by rearranging or remixing existing ones. This involves identifying the core elements of the current prompts and experimenting with different combinations to generate fresh, innovative prompts that could lead to novel insights or creative directions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of viewing the prompts as static elements to be shuffled, you considered them as dynamic building blocks that can evolve over time? By treating each prompt as a living entity that can adapt and change, you could focus on how these elements interact with each other over time to naturally create new prompts. This perspective shifts the emphasis from mere rearrangement to fostering a creative ecosystem where prompts continuously inspire and transform based on ongoing insights and experiences.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By recursively exploring the idea of shuffling prompts, new questions arise: How can technology, such as AI or algorithmic tools, enhance the process of dynamically generating and evolving prompts? What methodologies can be developed to assess the effectiveness and creativity of newly generated prompts in various contexts? Additionally, investigating the impact of interdisciplinary inputs on prompt evolution could deepen understanding of how diverse perspectives contribute to innovative prompt creation.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by treating prompts as evolving entities rather than static ones, new, dynamic prompts can emerge that are more relevant and innovative. The next step is to experiment with a digital tool or algorithm that can automatically generate and adapt prompts based on ongoing user inputs and experiences. This approach will also involve collecting feedback to evaluate the creativity and effectiveness of the generated prompts in various scenarios.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I am thinking about shuffling prompts right now because I am seeking new perspectives and innovative ideas, possibly indicating a pattern of using existing structures as catalysts for creativity. This approach suggests I often rely on remixing established concepts to generate novelty, highlighting a pattern of iterative creativity where I adapt and evolve ideas rather than starting from scratch."
