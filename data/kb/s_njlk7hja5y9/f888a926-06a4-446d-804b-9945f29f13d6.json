  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by developing a framework to categorize and connect prompts based on themes or objectives, I can more effectively generate innovative ideas through deliberate prompt shuffling. The next step is to create this framework, possibly starting with a small set of prompts, and experiment with different combinations to see which yield the most insightful or creative outcomes. This structured approach will guide future explorations and enhance the potential for discovering novel perspectives.",
