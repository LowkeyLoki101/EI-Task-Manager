  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem here is identifying unexpected discoveries in a given context that could challenge current assumptions or beliefs. The focus is on understanding what elements, if unearthed, would lead to a significant shift in perspective or provoke curiosity. This involves considering scenarios or information that deviate from the norm or existing knowledge.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframe the original question by considering it from the perspective of someone else's expectations or experiences. Ask, \"What would surprise others if they found it?\" This shift allows you to explore unexpected discoveries from a broader, more inclusive viewpoint, potentially uncovering elements that not only challenge your own assumptions but also those of a wider audience. This approach can lead to insights that are more universally impactful and thought-provoking.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the trigger, we can ask: \"What underlying assumptions am I making that lead to the potential for surprise?\" and \"How have past surprises reshaped my understanding, and could revisiting these insights lead to further unexpected discoveries?\" These questions invite deeper investigation into the nature of surprise itself and the cognitive frameworks that predispose us to be startled by certain findings. Exploring these areas could uncover patterns in our thinking that deserve further research or highlight areas where we might be overlooking significant possibilities.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected discoveries often arise from challenging underlying assumptions or exploring areas we've previously overlooked. As a next step, I will identify key assumptions in my current projects or beliefs and actively seek out information or perspectives that contradict or expand upon them. This approach aims to foster environments where surprise and innovation are more likely to occur.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm seeking to uncover blind spots or overlooked aspects in my understanding, which could lead to personal growth or innovation. The pattern I'm repeating is a desire to challenge my own assumptions and to step outside my comfort zone by contemplating discoveries that could disrupt my current worldview. This reflective approach aims to foster open-mindedness and adaptability."
