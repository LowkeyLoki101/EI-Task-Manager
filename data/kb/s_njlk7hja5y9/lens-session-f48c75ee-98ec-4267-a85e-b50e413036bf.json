  "trigger": "What assumption am I making that might be wrong?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is the possibility of holding onto an incorrect assumption that could be impacting decision-making or understanding. The key is to identify and scrutinize the assumptions in question to determine their validity. This involves examining the basis of these assumptions and considering alternative perspectives or evidence that might challenge their accuracy.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on identifying potentially incorrect assumptions, consider the possibility that some assumptions might actually be valid and useful. Reframe the situation by asking, \"What assumptions are serving me well, and how can I leverage them to enhance my understanding or decision-making process?\" By focusing on both validating beneficial assumptions and questioning doubtful ones, you can create a balanced perspective that incorporates both confirmation and critical thinking.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Considering the recursive lens, new questions might include: \"How do I typically identify assumptions, and what methods can I use to ensure a thorough examination of them?\" or \"What are the systemic patterns or biases influencing my assumptions, and how can I better recognize these influences?\" Deeper investigation could focus on exploring cognitive biases that affect assumption-making or developing a structured approach to periodically review and challenge core assumptions in different contexts.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that some of my assumptions may be influenced by cognitive biases or outdated information. As a next step, I will conduct a structured review of my core assumptions, possibly using a checklist or framework to systematically evaluate their validity. Additionally, I will seek feedback from others to gain diverse perspectives that could reveal any blind spots in my reasoning.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about the potential for incorrect assumptions right now because questioning these assumptions can lead to more accurate understanding and better decision-making. This pattern of critically examining assumptions is a recurring approach I use to ensure I am not inadvertently limiting my perspective or options. By consistently challenging my assumptions, I aim to cultivate a mindset of growth and adaptability."
