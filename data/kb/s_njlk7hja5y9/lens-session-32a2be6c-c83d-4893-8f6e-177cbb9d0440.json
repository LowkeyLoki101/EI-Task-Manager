  "trigger": "What assumption am I making about AI in the energy sector, and how would the outcome change if I considered the reverse?",
  "frameStep": "The assumption I'm making is that AI in the energy sector primarily leads to increased efficiency and reduced costs. If I considered the reverse, I would explore scenarios where AI could potentially increase complexity, lead to higher initial costs, or cause disruptions in energy management due to the need for significant infrastructure upgrades and adaptation challenges.",
  "reframeStep": "Reframing from a different perspective, consider the assumption that AI in the energy sector is primarily a disruptive force rather than a beneficial one. From this angle, explore how AI could introduce new vulnerabilities, such as cybersecurity risks or reliance on complex algorithms that may not be fully understood or controllable. This perspective encourages an examination of how AI might necessitate entirely new regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations, potentially slowing down its integration into the energy sector.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, further questions to explore include: How might increased AI-driven complexity in the energy sector affect workforce requirements and training programs? What are the potential environmental impacts of AI implementation, considering the energy consumption of the AI technologies themselves? Additionally, we should investigate how AI-induced shifts in the energy sector could alter market dynamics, potentially leading to new monopolies or shifts in energy accessibility and affordability. These areas deserve deeper research to fully understand the broader implications of AI integration in energy.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that while AI promises efficiency and cost-reduction in the energy sector, its integration might also introduce significant challenges such as increased complexity and cybersecurity risks. The next step is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of case studies where AI implementation has led to both positive and negative outcomes in the energy sector. This will help in developing a balanced understanding and in formulating strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with AI adoption.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now to challenge my preconceived notions about AI's role in the energy sector and to uncover potential blind spots in my understanding. I tend to approach technology with an optimistic bias, often focusing on its benefits rather than potential drawbacks. By examining this assumption from a meta-lens, I aim to balance my perspective, ensuring I consider both the positive and negative implications of AI integration, which will lead to more comprehensive and critical insights."
