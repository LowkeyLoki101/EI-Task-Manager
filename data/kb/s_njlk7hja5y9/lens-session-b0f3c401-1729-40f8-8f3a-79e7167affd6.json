  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea is centered around uncovering unexpected or surprising information. I see a scenario where the discovery of something unforeseen could challenge existing assumptions or provide new insights. The key is identifying what specific information, if discovered, would defy current expectations or beliefs.",
  "reframeStep": "What if you approached this question by considering how different environments or contexts could influence what surprises you? Instead of focusing on specific information that might surprise you, think about how changing the setting—such as shifting from a work context to a personal one—could alter your expectations and therefore what would be considered unexpected. This reframe invites you to explore the role of context and assumptions in shaping what you perceive as surprising.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens, new questions arise: How do my existing beliefs and assumptions limit what I consider surprising? What are the underlying biases or cognitive frameworks that shape my expectations across different contexts? Delving deeper, it would be valuable to investigate how these cognitive biases develop over time and what strategies can be employed to systematically challenge and expand them, enabling a broader range of potential surprises.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that unexpected surprises often arise from challenging my own cognitive biases and assumptions. The next step is to actively seek out environments or contexts that differ from my norm, paying attention to how they shift my expectations. I will document these experiences and reflections to identify patterns in what genuinely surprises me, which can then inform future inquiries and exploration.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question because it challenges my existing assumptions and pushes me towards discovering novel insights. By examining this through a meta-lens, I recognize a recurring pattern in my approach: I often focus on the immediate context without considering how broader perspectives or different environments could shift my expectations. This reflection suggests a need to regularly step back and consider how varying contexts might alter what I find surprising, thereby enriching my understanding and adaptability."
