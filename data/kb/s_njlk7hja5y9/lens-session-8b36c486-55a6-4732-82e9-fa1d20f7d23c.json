  "trigger": "What problem am I avoiding thinking about?",
  "frameStep": "The problem I am avoiding is identifying and confronting a specific issue in my life that requires attention, perhaps due to fear, discomfort, or uncertainty about how to address it. This avoidance might stem from the potential emotional or practical challenges involved in facing the problem directly. By clearly defining what the problem is, I can begin to understand why I'm avoiding it and consider steps to address it.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of seeing the issue as a problem you're avoiding, reframe it as an opportunity for growth and learning. What if this avoidance is actually a signal pointing you toward an area of personal development that could lead to significant positive change in your life? By viewing the issue as a chance to enhance your skills or emotional resilience, you shift the focus from fear and discomfort to potential and empowerment.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What specific aspects of the problem are most intimidating or unclear, and why do they elicit avoidance? Are there underlying beliefs or past experiences that contribute to this avoidance? Further exploration might involve examining how similar issues have been handled in the past, identifying patterns of avoidance, and investigating resources or support systems that could help in addressing the problem effectively.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that the problem I'm avoiding is directly linked to fear of failure or discomfort. The next step is to identify one small, manageable action I can take today to confront this issue, such as journaling about my feelings or discussing them with a trusted friend. By taking this initial step, I can begin to reduce avoidance and gain clarity on how to proceed further.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this right now because it highlights a recurring pattern of avoidance in my approach to challenges, which could be hindering my personal and professional growth. This pattern might involve a tendency to focus on short-term comfort over long-term benefits, often due to fear or uncertainty. By using a meta-lens, I can gain insight into this pattern and consciously work to break it, enabling me to engage more proactively with challenges as opportunities for growth."
