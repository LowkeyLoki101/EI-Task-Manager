  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea to frame is the unexpected discovery of something that would surprise me. This involves identifying what lies outside my current assumptions or expectations. I need to consider areas where I have strong beliefs or where I rarely question the status quo, as surprises often stem from unchallenged assumptions.",
  "reframeStep": "From a different perspective, consider the question: \"What if the surprising discovery is not about the content itself, but rather about my reaction to it?\" This shifts the focus from the external discovery to an internal introspection. By examining why certain discoveries surprise me, I can uncover deeper insights into my own biases, expectations, and thought patterns. This reframing encourages exploration of the emotional and cognitive processes that shape my perception of surprise, thus broadening my understanding of both the discovery and my personal development.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What deeper insights could be gained by exploring why certain discoveries surprise me? Are there underlying patterns or biases in my thinking that consistently lead to surprise, and how can understanding these help me anticipate or even welcome unexpected findings in the future? Additionally, how might my surprise differ across various contexts or topics, and what does this reveal about my values and priorities? Investigating these questions can lead to a more profound understanding of my cognitive processes and help cultivate a mindset more open to novelty and change.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that surprises often stem from areas where my assumptions remain unchallenged. Therefore, my next step is to actively seek out and question these assumptions, especially in areas where I feel most confident or certain. This could involve engaging with diverse perspectives, reading materials outside my usual interests, or reflecting on recent experiences to identify moments of unexpected reactions. By doing so, I aim to better understand my biases and cultivate a more open mindset towards unexpected discoveries.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because I'm exploring the boundaries of my understanding and aiming to challenge my assumptions to foster personal and intellectual growth. The pattern I'm repeating is a habitual focus on external discoveries rather than considering how my internal reactions and biases shape my perception of surprise. By applying a meta-lens, I can shift from a purely content-driven inquiry to one that also examines the underlying cognitive and emotional processes, encouraging a more holistic and introspective approach."
