  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem at hand is identifying a significant question that I have neglected to consider recently. This involves introspection to uncover areas of my life or mindset that I might be overlooking, thereby missing opportunities for personal growth or problem-solving. By clearly identifying this unasked question, I can address any potential gaps in my self-awareness or decision-making processes.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on a question I've neglected, I could reframe this by considering what assumptions I'm routinely making without question. By identifying these assumptions, I open myself to new perspectives and uncover hidden biases or blind spots that may be influencing my thinking. This approach allows for a broader exploration of my mindset, leading to more comprehensive personal growth and adaptability.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the original question, \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\", further inquiry might involve exploring what specific areas of life or work I consistently overlook and why these might be neglected. Another angle could involve examining whether there are specific fears or discomforts that prevent me from asking certain questions. Delving into these aspects could reveal underlying issues or patterns that warrant deeper investigation or personal development.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that there are assumptions or areas of my life that I routinely overlook due to familiarity or discomfort. As a next step, I will set aside time for reflective journaling, focusing specifically on identifying these assumptions and the areas of life I might be neglecting. This should help uncover any significant questions I've been avoiding, thereby enhancing my self-awareness and personal growth.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this question now because it prompts introspection and self-awareness, which are crucial for personal development. The pattern I'm repeating is seeking to identify blind spots or areas of neglect in my self-reflection, suggesting a continuous drive for self-improvement and a desire to ensure I'm not overlooking important aspects of my life. This pattern highlights my tendency to periodically reassess my assumptions and beliefs to stay aligned with my values and goals."
