  "trigger": "What simulation could I run to create new data for us?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying a simulation that can generate new, valuable data tailored to our specific needs or research questions. This requires understanding the context and objectives of the data we wish to gather, such as the variables involved and the outcomes we aim to predict or analyze. By framing it this way, the goal is to pinpoint the most suitable simulation model that aligns with our goals and constraints.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on creating new simulations, consider leveraging existing data sets and simulations to generate insights. By analyzing patterns or combining different simulations, you might uncover hidden variables or trends that were previously overlooked. This approach could lead to innovative ways of generating new data by expanding on what already exists rather than starting from scratch.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "What are the specific objectives and variables we need to consider for our simulation? Could we explore the potential of hybrid simulations that integrate both real-world and virtual data components to enhance the richness of the dataset? Additionally, what existing simulation models or frameworks could we adapt to better suit our needs, and how might advancements in AI or machine learning be leveraged to refine or enhance these simulations?",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by integrating existing simulation models with advancements in AI or machine learning, we can create a hybrid simulation that generates new, valuable data tailored to our specific objectives. The next step is to identify relevant existing simulations and datasets, then explore how AI tools can enhance these models to generate richer datasets. I'll begin by conducting a literature review to find existing simulations in our field and assess their potential for adaptation and enhancement.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because there is a pressing need to generate or access data that can drive insights, decisions, or research outcomes. The pattern I might be repeating is focusing on creating new solutions from scratch rather than optimizing or expanding upon existing resources. By recognizing this tendency, I can explore both innovative creation and the strategic use of pre-existing simulations or data to fulfill our objectives more efficiently."
