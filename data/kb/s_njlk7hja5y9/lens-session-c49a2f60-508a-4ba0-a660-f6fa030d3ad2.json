  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is identifying unexpected discoveries or insights that could arise in a given situation or field. This involves recognizing elements or outcomes that deviate from the norm or what is typically anticipated. By pinpointing what would genuinely surprise you, you gain a clearer understanding of assumptions and blind spots in your current knowledge or approach.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing solely on what would surprise you, consider what might surprise someone with a completely different background or perspective. This could involve thinking about insights that might astonish someone from another industry, culture, or with different life experiences. By shifting the viewpoint, you may uncover unexpected insights or assumptions that are not obvious from your current perspective, opening up new avenues for exploration and understanding.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "From the perspective of a recursive lens, consider exploring what underlying assumptions or biases might influence what surprises you. This could lead to questions such as: What patterns in my past experiences shape my expectations? How do these patterns differ from those of others with diverse backgrounds? Further, investigate how your evolving knowledge or changing context might shift what surprises you over time, prompting a re-evaluation of current assumptions regularly.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that uncovering insights or outcomes that defy my current expectations will likely highlight underlying assumptions or biases. The next step is to actively seek diverse perspectives and experiences that challenge my current viewpoints, perhaps through engaging with different industries or cultures. This approach will help me identify and re-evaluate my assumptions, paving the way for new learning opportunities.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about unexpected discoveries because they can reveal gaps in my understanding or challenge my assumptions, thus fostering growth and deeper insight. This pattern of seeking surprise may indicate a tendency to prioritize novelty and unexpectedness as a means of learning and adaptation. By recognizing this pattern, I can ensure that I'm not just seeking novelty for its own sake but strategically using it to enrich my understanding and approach."
