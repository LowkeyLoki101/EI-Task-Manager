  "trigger": "What pattern do I keep seeing that others might be missing?",
  "frameStep": "I notice that there's a recurring pattern of inefficiencies in how our team communicates during projects, which often leads to misunderstandings and delays. This issue seems to go unnoticed by others, possibly because they are focused on their individual tasks rather than the overall workflow. Addressing this could enhance our productivity and collaboration.",
  "reframeStep": "What if the pattern of communication inefficiencies is not just a team issue but a systemic one influenced by organizational culture or outdated processes? From this perspective, addressing the problem might require a broader approach that involves re-evaluating company-wide communication protocols or investing in modern collaboration tools. This shift in focus could uncover deeper underlying issues and lead to more sustainable improvements in how projects are managed across the organization.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Given the recurring pattern of communication inefficiencies, new questions arise: How do different teams within the organization perceive and handle communication challenges? Are there specific tools or methods that have been effective in enhancing communication elsewhere? It might be valuable to investigate whether these inefficiencies stem from a lack of training or awareness about available communication tools. Additionally, exploring the impact of these communication barriers on project outcomes could provide deeper insights into the extent of the issue and inform potential solutions.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that communication inefficiencies within the team are not isolated incidents but part of a broader organizational issue. The next step is to conduct a survey or interviews across different teams to gather insights on their communication practices and challenges. This data will help identify common barriers and inform the development of a more comprehensive strategy to enhance communication, possibly including training sessions or the implementation of new collaboration tools.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this pattern because it's impacting our team's effectiveness and my awareness of it might provide an opportunity for improvement that others haven't identified yet. I tend to focus on systemic issues, which leads me to consider broader organizational changes rather than just addressing surface-level symptoms. This approach repeats a pattern where I look beyond immediate problems to understand and address root causes."
