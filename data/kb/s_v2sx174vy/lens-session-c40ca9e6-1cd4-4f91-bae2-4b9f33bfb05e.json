  "trigger": "What would surprise me if I found it?",
  "frameStep": "The problem or idea at hand is exploring unexpected discoveries or insights that could arise in a given situation. Specifically, it involves identifying and articulating what kinds of findings or occurrences would be surprising to you in a particular context, whether in personal, professional, or any other area of interest. This requires examining assumptions and considering what lies outside of current expectations.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on what would surprise you, consider what might surprise others in the same situation. How do their expectations differ from yours, and what unique insights could this provide about collective assumptions or overlooked possibilities? By shifting the perspective to include others' potential surprises, you can gain a broader understanding of the situation and uncover hidden opportunities or challenges.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Exploring what would surprise others in the same context might lead to questions about the underlying assumptions held by different groups and how these influence their expectations. What cultural, social, or psychological factors contribute to these differing expectations, and how can they be systematically identified and analyzed? Additionally, investigating how these surprises might impact decision-making or innovation processes could offer deeper insights into managing expectations and leveraging unexpected findings for growth or change.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that identifying what would surprise me involves uncovering overlooked or underestimated factors in a given situation. The next step is to actively seek perspectives from others who are also involved or affected, as their potential surprises might highlight diverse assumptions or gaps in understanding. This can be actioned by conducting interviews or surveys to gather varied insights, which would enrich the analysis and identify unexpected findings that could lead to strategic adjustments or innovations.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this because I'm trying to break out of my usual thought patterns and challenge my assumptions. This pattern of seeking surprises might indicate a desire to innovate or discover new perspectives, suggesting that I'm often looking for ways to broaden my understanding or disrupt conventional thinking. By recognizing this, I can better align my approach with creative problem-solving or strategic exploration."
