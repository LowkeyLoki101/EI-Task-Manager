The next step is to actively seek perspectives from others who are also involved or affected, as their potential surprises might highlight diverse assumptions or gaps in understanding. This can be actioned by conducting interviews or surveys to gather varied insights, which would enrich the analysis and identify unexpected findings that could lead to strategic adjustments or innovations.",
