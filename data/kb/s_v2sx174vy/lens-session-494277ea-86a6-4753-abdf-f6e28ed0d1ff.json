  "trigger": "If I shuffled my own prompts, what new ones emerge?",
  "frameStep": "The problem involves discovering new insights or perspectives by rearranging existing prompts. By shuffling the prompts, I can create novel combinations and ideas that may not have been immediately apparent, thereby sparking creativity and innovation. The focus is on exploring how different configurations of prompts can lead to unexpected and valuable new questions or solutions.",
  "reframeStep": "What if instead of viewing the shuffling of prompts as a way to generate new ideas, we consider it as an exercise in understanding the underlying structure and connections between existing ideas? By focusing on the relationships between prompts, we might uncover patterns or themes that were previously unnoticed, leading to deeper insights into how different aspects of a topic interrelate. This perspective shifts the emphasis from creating new prompts to enhancing comprehension and integration of existing knowledge.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "By shuffling prompts, what connections between seemingly disparate ideas might become apparent, and how can these connections be leveraged to address complex problems? Additionally, what methodologies or frameworks can be developed for systematically exploring these new relationships, ensuring that insights gained from the shuffled prompts are both actionable and meaningful? These questions invite further exploration into the cognitive processes involved in creative thinking and problem-solving.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that shuffling prompts can illuminate hidden connections and themes, enhancing understanding and potentially leading to innovative solutions. As a next step, I will systematically shuffle a set of my existing prompts and analyze the new combinations for emergent patterns or insights. This exercise will inform whether a structured methodology can be developed to harness these connections for complex problem-solving.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about shuffling prompts because I'm seeking to disrupt my usual patterns of thinking and uncover hidden connections between ideas. This approach reflects a broader pattern of using creativity and innovation to solve problems by reconfiguring existing elements rather than starting from scratch. By examining my motivation, I realize I'm driven by a desire to deepen understanding and foster innovation through novel combinations of familiar concepts."
