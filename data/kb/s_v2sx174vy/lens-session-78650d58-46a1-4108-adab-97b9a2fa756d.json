  "trigger": "What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?",
  "frameStep": "The problem is identifying important or reflective questions that have been neglected over time but could provide valuable insights or lead to personal growth. I see the opportunity to explore areas of life that have been overlooked, such as personal goals, relationships, or self-care, by revisiting questions that haven't been considered recently. This can help in understanding what aspects of life need more attention or reevaluation.",
  "reframeStep": "Instead of focusing on questions that haven't been asked, what if you reframe the situation by asking: \"What assumptions have I been making without questioning them?\" This approach shifts the focus from identifying forgotten queries to challenging ingrained beliefs or routines that may not serve you well. By examining and questioning these assumptions, you open up avenues for growth and change that might have been previously overlooked.",
  "metaLensStep": null,
  "recursiveStep": "Applying the recursive lens to the question \"What's a question I haven't asked myself in a while?\" can lead to further exploration by asking, \"What areas of my life have I neglected to reflect on, and why?\" This could prompt a deeper investigation into specific life domains—such as career, health, or personal development—that might benefit from renewed focus. Additionally, it raises the question, \"How do I prioritize which neglected questions to explore first?\" which could guide a more structured approach to self-reflection and growth.",
  "closureStep": "My working hypothesis is that by exploring neglected areas of my life and questioning underlying assumptions, I can uncover potential growth opportunities. The next step is to list key life domains—such as career, relationships, and personal well-being—and identify assumptions or questions related to each that I have not recently considered. I'll prioritize these based on their potential impact on my overall satisfaction and development, and set aside time weekly to reflect on and address them.",

  "meta_lensStep": "I'm thinking about this now because it reflects a desire for introspection and personal growth, highlighting a pattern of seeking deeper understanding and self-awareness. This approach often involves revisiting past insights and assumptions to ensure they still align with current values and goals. By identifying overlooked questions or assumptions, I aim to break habitual thinking and stimulate fresh perspectives that can lead to meaningful changes."
