  "content": "Generated from lens processing: My working hypothesis is that by exploring neglected areas of my life and questioning underlying assumptions, I can uncover potential growth opportunities. The next step is to list key life domains—such as career, relationships, and personal well-being—and identify assumptions or questions related to each that I have not recently considered. I'll prioritize these based on their potential impact on my overall satisfaction and development, and set aside time weekly to reflect on and address them.",
