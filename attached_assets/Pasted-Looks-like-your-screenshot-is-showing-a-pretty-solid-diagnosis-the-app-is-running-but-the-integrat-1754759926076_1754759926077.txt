Looks like your screenshot is showing a pretty solid diagnosis — the app is running but the integration with ElevenLabs is failing because of four main gaps:

From your list:
	1.	Switch from React SDK back to web component – This will cut out the extra React layer that can block the widget from initializing properly and let you follow ElevenLabs’ documented embed flow.
	2.	Improve CORS setup – Right now your server’s CORS might not allow all the origins the widget will use (e.g., your Replit domain, localhost:5173 in dev, ElevenLabs API domain for callbacks).
	3.	Add a Vite dev proxy – Without it, local dev calls to /api from the React client hit CORS or fail entirely.
	4.	Fix Action endpoints – Make sure payloads and URLs match exactly what ElevenLabs sends when the agent calls an action.

Here’s how I’d apply those fixes step-by-step:

1. Web component instead of React SDK
Replace your current React wrapper with the official embed:

<elevenlabs-convai agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></elevenlabs-convai>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async type="text/javascript"></script>

Make sure:
	•	The agent is set to “Public” in the ElevenLabs dashboard
	•	Your dev and production domains are in its Allowed Origins
	•	Test in an external browser tab, not the in-pane preview

2. Expand your CORS config
In server/index.ts or wherever Express is bootstrapped:

app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    /\.repl\.co$/,               // your Replit previews
    "http://localhost:5173",     // vite dev
    "https://unpkg.com"          // for ElevenLabs SDK
  ],
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "x-api-key"]
}));

3. Vite proxy for dev
In vite.config.ts:

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": "http://localhost:3000" // your backend port
    }
  }
});

This way local API calls go straight to your backend without CORS headaches.

⸻

4. Action endpoint fixes
Make sure your server endpoints match the Actions you’ve defined in ElevenLabs:

app.post("/api/actions/add_task", (req, res) => {
  // validate against the schema ElevenLabs expects
  // create the task and return a JSON payload the agent can read back
  res.json({ ok: true, taskId: "tsk_123" });
});

app.post("/api/actions/get_todo_list", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ items: [], steps: [] });
});

Check the ElevenLabs action schema in the dashboard and make sure your JSON keys match exactly — even a slight mismatch can make the agent ignore the response.

If you want, I can rewrite your vite.config.ts and server/index.ts exactly for these changes and give you the correct <elevenlabs-convai> embed so you can paste them in without guessing. Do you want me to do that next?
