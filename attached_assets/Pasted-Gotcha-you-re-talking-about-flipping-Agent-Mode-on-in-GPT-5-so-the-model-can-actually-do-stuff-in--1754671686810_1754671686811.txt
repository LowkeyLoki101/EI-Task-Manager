Gotcha—you’re talking about flipping Agent Mode on (in GPT-5) so the model can actually do stuff in a sandbox: browse, run code, write files, call APIs, fill forms—then stitching that with Replit + ElevenLabs. Here’s how to use it and how to patch the gaps where the built-in “virtual environment” falls short.

⸻

What “Agent Mode” gives you

Think of it as a tool-calling runtime with a sandbox:
	•	Built-ins (varies by provider/plan): web browsing/fetch, code execution, file I/O, “computer use”/headless browser.
	•	Tool schema: you expose server endpoints (or local actions) as JSON-callable tools; the model chooses when to call them.
	•	State: model memory + files it’s created in the sandbox + conversation context.

You’ll wire ElevenLabs widget → conversational layer → Agent Mode (GPT-5) with a tool registry → your actions proxy on Replit. The model is the planner; your proxy actually does the work.

When to use Agent Mode vs. Replit scripts

Use Agent Mode for:
	•	Short, interactive steps: fetch page, parse table, draft email, generate file, quick research.
	•	Iterative reasoning loops: “Try A → didn’t work → adjust → try B.”

Use Replit jobs/scripts (outside Agent Mode) for:
	•	Long-running or flaky tasks (hours, big downloads, large OCR).
	•	Anything needing deterministic pipelines (ETL, PDF batch, nightly sync).
	•	Actions needing headless browsers with strict control (Playwright flows) or 2FA.

You’ll expose those Replit jobs as tools the agent can invoke.

Minimal wiring you need

1) Define an Actions Proxy (one API the model calls)
	•	Route: POST /api/agent/actions
	•	Input: { sessionId, action: "web.search"|"files.write"|"run.python"|..., args: {...} }
	•	Output: { ok, data, error? }
	•	The proxy dispatches to safe implementations (server-side), logs, and returns.

// /pages/api/agent/actions.ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') return res.status(405).end();
  const { sessionId, action, args } = req.body || {};
  try {
    switch (action) {
      case 'web.search':      return res.json(await webSearch(args));
      case 'web.fetch':       return res.json(await webFetch(args));
      case 'files.write':     return res.json(await filesWrite(sessionId, args));
      case 'files.read':      return res.json(await filesRead(sessionId, args));
      case 'run.node':        return res.json(await runNode(args));       // small, time-boxed
      case 'run.python':      return res.json(await runPython(args));     // small, time-boxed
      case 'playwright.flow': return res.json(await runPlaywrightFlow(args)); // “computer use”
      case 'queue.job':       return res.json(await enqueueJob(args));    // long running
      default: return res.status(400).json({ ok:false, error:'unknown_action' });
    }
  } catch (e:any) {
    return res.status(500).json({ ok:false, error: e.message });
  }
}

2) Register tools to GPT-5 (Agent Mode)

Give the model a tool manifest (function schema). Example:

[
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "web_search",
      "description": "Search the web and return top results.",
      "parameters": { "type":"object", "properties":{"q":{"type":"string"}}, "required":["q"] }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "files_write",
      "description": "Write text to a file in the session workspace.",
      "parameters": {
        "type":"object",
        "properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"content":{"type":"string"}},
        "required":["path","content"]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "youtube_search",
      "description": "Find how-to videos; return videoId/title/url.",
      "parameters": { "type":"object","properties":{"q":{"type":"string"},"max":{"type":"number"}}, "required":["q"] }
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "queue_job",
      "description": "Submit a long-running job (ETL/OCR/batch). Returns jobId.",
      "parameters": { "type":"object","properties":{"kind":{"type":"string"},"payload":{"type":"object"}}, "required":["kind","payload"] }
    }
  }
]

In your server tick (Supervisor), when GPT-5 calls a tool, relay to /api/agent/actions with your action names.

3) Safety rails you must apply
	•	Time + size limits for code runs (e.g., 10s, 64MB).
	•	Network allowlist for web fetch (only public docs, not your internal admin).
	•	Path sandbox (only allow /data/<sessionId>/...).
	•	Secrets never in browser; all keys stay server-side.
	•	Human confirm before sending emails/SMS or submitting forms.

Filling the gaps Agent Mode may have

Some providers lock down:
	•	File system perms or no binary deps → fall back to your Replit runner via queue_job.
	•	Headless UI automation not available → use Playwright scripts (your code), expose as playwright.flow.
	•	No external program execution → prebuild microservices (OCR, PDF split, Whisper) and call them via HTTP tools.
	•	Session persistence limited → store your own memory (tasks.json, forms.json, kb.json) keyed by sessionId.

Example: Playwright “fill form” flow
	1.	Model plans: “Open site, search, fill checkout.”
	2.	It calls tool:

{
  "name": "playwright.flow",
  "arguments": {
    "script": "checkout",
    "params": { "url": "https://example.com", "email": "x@y.com", "zip":"77001" }
  }
}

	3.	Your server runs scripts/checkout.ts in a hardened worker, returns { ok:true, artifacts:[screenshotUrl], events:[...] }.

How this works with your stack

ElevenLabs widget = liaison
	•	Captures voice/text, displays replies.
	•	For every transcript chunk: POST to /api/supervisor/ingest.

GPT-5 Supervisor (Agent Mode ON)
	•	Reads recent convo + task state.
	•	Decides next actions:
	•	Update the rolling to-do (add/complete/subtasks/due times).
	•	Call tools (search, fetch, write, run code, Playwright).
	•	Save outputs (files, forms).
	•	Ask clarifying questions via the chat when needed.
	•	Returns a plan JSON which your server applies (so UI updates are deterministic).

Replit executor & jobs
	•	The /api/agent/actions proxy handles quick calls.
	•	/api/agent/actions -> queue_job posts long work to a job queue (BullMQ, simple cron, or Replit background task).
	•	Jobs write artifacts to /data/<sessionId>/... and post a note back into the chat or tasks.

⸻

Concrete examples the model can do (today)
	•	“Find a video and set a reminder”
Calls youtube_search → adds task “Change tire” with resources[] → sets dueAt → at time, opens your video modal.
	•	“Research breaker box labeling best practices and draft a PDF”
web_search → files_write (markdown) → run.node to render MD → save /files/labeling-guide.pdf.
	•	“Fill this warranty form”
Collect fields conversationally → forms.save → playwright.flow to submit site form → return confirmation screenshot.
	•	“Summarize this PDF and email it to me”
Upload → OCR/parse (job if large) → summary → send_email.

Drop-in: one tool call from the model → your proxy

(If you’re already using the Supervisor /tick route, just add this relay.)

// inside your GPT-5 tool handler:
const toolReturn = await fetch(`${process.env.BASE_URL}/api/agent/actions`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type':'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    sessionId,
    action: mapToAction(tc.function.name), // e.g., web_search -> 'web.search'
    args: JSON.parse(tc.function.arguments||'{}')
  })
}).then(r=>r.json());

TL;DR setup checklist
	1.	Create /api/agent/actions proxy with safe dispatch + limits.
	2.	Register tool schemas to GPT-5 (web_search, web_fetch, files.{read,write}, run.{node,python}, youtube_search, playwright.flow, queue_job, forms.save, send_email, send_sms).
	3.	Add confirmation rule for comms.
	4.	Add job queue for long tasks and a “job finished” notifier.
	5.	Keep session memory (tasks, forms, files) in your storage.
	6.	Use ElevenLabs purely as the user liaison; all real work funnels through the Agent Mode tool chain.

If you want, I can hand you a ready-to-paste tool manifest + action proxy that includes a tiny Playwright runner and a job queue stub—so Agent Mode is live in like 15 minutes.
