Good catch sharing the JSON — that explains the “sessionId: unknown” thing perfectly.

Right now your add_task tool says:

{
  "id": "sessionId",
  "type": "string",
  "value_type": "llm_prompt",   <-- this is the problem
  "dynamic_variable": "",
  "required": true
}

That tells ElevenLabs: “ask the model to guess the sessionId from what the user says.” The model has no clue, so you get "unknown".

You want the tool to say: “use the dynamic variable named sessionId that my page provides.”

Fix (Form mode, exact clicks)
	•	Open add_task → Edit.
	•	Body parameters → find the sessionId property.
	•	Value Type: change from LLM Prompt → Dynamic variable.
	•	A small input appears; type sessionId in that box (exactly).
	•	Save.

(why: Dynamic variable = “fill this from the host app”, not from the transcript.)

If you prefer JSON (just this property)

Replace only the sessionId property with:

{
  "id": "sessionId",
  "type": "string",
  "value_type": "dynamic_variable",
  "dynamic_variable": "sessionId",
  "description": "Session identifier for this user.",
  "required": true
}

Everything else in your tool JSON can stay as-is.

Also make sure the widget provides it

Your React hook is creating the value, but the widget needs to receive it:

useEffect(() => {
  const el = document.querySelector("elevenlabs-convai");
  if (el && sessionId) {
    el.setAttribute("dynamic-variables", JSON.stringify({ sessionId }));
  }
}, [sessionId]);

(If you don’t set this attribute, the dynamic variable is empty → “unknown”.)

Quick test
	1.	Refresh your page (so the widget re-initializes with the attribute).
	2.	Speak: “Create a task to call Lauren.”
	3.	In your Replit logs you should now see:

{
  "sessionId": "s_abcdef...", 
  "title": "Call Lauren",
  "context": "phone",
  "steps": []
}

(If you still see "unknown", it means either the tool field is still set to LLM Prompt, or the widget attribute isn’t being set. Double-check both.)

Want me to do the same change for get_todo_list next (it also needs sessionId as a Dynamic variable)?
